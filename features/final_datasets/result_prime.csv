citizens of us will not have access to the simple knowledge of all the minerals vitamins proteins and multitude of healthy hidden ingredients that this superfood offers at a reasonable price but yet they have all the nutritional value of chia seeds which hardly has any vitamin or mineral but yet a whopping fiber at a whopping price since it is no threat to any industry in us shame shame shame while hemp and marijuana are kissing cousins the amount of thc in hemp is almost non existent two tablespoons contains  milligrams of antiinflammatory gammalinolenic acid and  grams of  fats plus all nine essential amino acids compounds that help maximize recovery from workouts i consume these straight from the container with spoon an hour before my work outs without mixing in a bowl or as dressing i consume it first thing in the morning or when i need a quick burst of energy regardless of the time of the day for years i have consumed  sunflower seeds  in water  sesameflax seeds ground in coffee makercocoa powderunflavoured protein isolate  seeds   garlic on daily basis seeds all go rancid due to the oil and the germ of the seed so regardless of the type or brand seeds need to be stored in freezer in a dark cold sealed container away from any moisture if plastic container then it needs to be  or for me it is much safer in glass containers that keeps air out i consume seeds within two weeks and insure not to purchase in big quantities since freshness is a priority to me due to the nutritional value which i consume food for any food hemp is an unbelievable product and you can not grow it in us since it is illegal and big business does not want to see you healthy no gain for big industries either since it is so cheap to grow with so many benefits that scares big pharma plastic industry fabriccotton industry pesticide producers etc so if you live in us canada becomes your only hope hemp increases my level of energy without any artificial stimulants like caffeine and sugar more energy with less empty calorie fillers like sugar and saturated fat in all energy bars which i never consume hemp contains the highest percentage of globulin than any other plant which is an essential amino acid that helps my body to create antibodies a component of a healthy immune system healthy addition to a weight loss plan since it provides essential nutrients such as protein essential fatty acids fibre vitamins and minerals without adding an excess amount of calories starch sugar or salt one of the best natural boosters that i can get when doing any type of sport or when i need energy without a big meal hemp is truly a good plant for the environment and it is shame that we have to deal with the politics of the hemp instead of the benefits of the hemp in us victim of its own success this is a super food next to quinoa kale broccoli dandelion raw honey garlic legumes nuts seeds etc organic is always better for the planet earth and its inhabitants thank you thank you thank you canadaminerals hemp is one of the kings of nutrients when it comes to minerals and so important to me as a whole delicious seed with highest magnesium highest potassium highest zinc and the healthiest fataccordingly for  servings size ofsesameflaxchiaamaranthquinoahemppistachioalmondcashewpeanutavocadocaloriessat fatcalciummagnesiumpotassiumzincfiber phytosterolsfreshness fresh means nutritious and delicious i consume lots of seeds beans grains vegetables etc and freshness is a priority regardless of the brand so i always purchase my food ingredients in small quantities from reputable sellers with high turnover when fresh food is nutritious and that goes for any food in any form from frozen to canned fresh food is nutritious as well as delicious since nutrients give food its delicious taste when old or rancid nutrients are gone and any food item becomes an empty calories with no taste and absolutely worthless regardless of the brand or price organic or conventional for few years i consumed seeds in oil form since physicians advised me to do so not knowing that majority are not aware that seeds hardly offer any nutrients unless seeds are fresh not old which means rancid not in oil form not in supplement form not hulled ground and consumed within few days kept in dark cold temperatures away from lightsunmoisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless that is why brown rice which has its nutrients will go rancid even if kept in freezer while white rice will last for years at room temperature since it hardly has any nutrients or oil i ground in my coffee grinder sesame flax chia amaranth hemp then add cocoa isolate protein soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins minerals protein and many nutrients without much spike in my glucose unhulled seeds are full of nutrients i never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removedcarbohydrates carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in the muscles which weigh something like  grams per kilo of muscle protein and fats do not get stored as glycogen additional weight if you are a marathon runner then it is not important how healthy or fit you may feel or look since if you did not consume enough carbohydrates then there is not enough glycogen in your muscles and you will not finish the marathon regardless so i want healthy fat not carbohydrates i want muscles not glycogen except on the days that i surf for hours and hoursfat the most important hormone and the one thats crucial for weight loss is insulin insulin is the hormone that controls fat storage a highcarb diet increases the amount of glucose in the bloodstream which in turn means you produce more insulin the more insulin the body produces the more fat gets stored a lowcarb diet means less insulin making it easier to lose weight because less fat is then stored for intake of a massive  calories every day for three weeks with calories from a lowfat highcarb diet and for another three weeks with calories from more fat no carbs with exactly the same amount of calories with moderate exercise regimen each time lowfat diet stacked on  with   around the middle where the high fat diet offered a loss of  lb and loss of  from waistline if calorie is calorie then in my case and my experience shows that i would prefer to get my calories from a healthy fat from sesame seed and almond than the calories from the carbs in chia almonds have the highest fat calories from all the seeds and nuts and that is a priority to me in type of calories since i am kind of vegan who consumes fish but hardly any meat or chickenaccordingly for  servings size

avocado offers so many calories from fat but from mono and poly fats which is the same for sesame seed as well making those superdfoods with lots of other nutrients as well calories from fat are only healthy when such food is low in saturated fat and high in poly or mono fats junk food usually provides a large number of calories per serving with the majority of the calories from fat unhealthy saturated fat with no poly or mono fats on a  calorie diet need to consume less than  grams of fat a day for those reasons even consuming too many cashews are unhealthy since cashews hardly offer nutrients except high in zinc but very high in saturated fat for almost the same total calories sesame offers half of chias carb calories gain but  more fat calories with high amount of nutrients for

B0014D5NVS,3.0,i hate that this leaves a weird sticky residue on any object that it comes into contact withit just makes the plates feel dirty  i mainly just use this to cover up the smoke detectors within my apartment because they are way to sensitive and go off even when i am boiling water on the stove top  so to keep my sanity i simply cover them up  it works great  if the apartment actually gets smoky then the alarm still goes off as we discovered after a piece of toast became quite burntit does do a good job sealing food and liquid  it is also great to use for any nonstick bake ware because the regular cling wrap wont stick to that and aluminum foil doesnt create a strong seal to keep the bake goods freshwe love trix tracks  my son and i both enjoy setting up the tracks into different configurations  we have  sets so far and im looking to expand  i think they are well made and the pieces fit together easily  of course sometimes it takes some rearranging of the track in order to get the marble to roll down appropriately  however this is mainly a problem when i am trying to mix all four sets together  if one were to just construct the track based on the directions that come with that set then they would have absolutely no problem  we started out with two sets last year when my son was   he was a little to young  he would enjoy watching the marble go down the track through the different elements but he wasnt really able to construct the track on his own  this year he is able to set up the track  i still help him but now he definitely can interact with the toy as intended  this is what led us to purchasing two more setsthe only quibble i have is that it would be great especially for the price of a set if they would include more supportive orange blocks  once we had all  sets and tried to combine them we found that we really couldnt utilize all the elements unless we had more orange supports  so i bought  more orange brick supports through amazon for  and so far so good  it seems like now we have enough  so if they could simply add an additional  tracks per kitthen that amount would be perfect and much appreciatedthe item arrived quickly within  days of my order being placed  the item was as described on the product page  the product was packaged well with largesized bubble wrap surrounding the item to ensure it arrived safely  the package was intact without any smashed corners upon arrival,glad pressn seal food plastic wrap   square foot roll,2.94,0.5299334811529933,,,-369.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,171,56,158,56,277,64,228,64,0.82,0.28,0.33,0.19,2.41,1.1,171,42,42.8,39.8,0.62,0.82,7.27,10.27,0.91,28.48,0.69,0.81,46.41,4.82,0.25,0.65,0.13,0.08,0.21

B00I9KQJYY,5.0,these are my absolute favorite diapers since my son was born feb  and will continue to be my first choice with my second due march  recent reviews have been negative though so i wanted to say a few thingsthese diapers hold a lot but you need to check your kids and make sure they arent filling it every diaper has a limit and its your job as a parent to check and change frequently if there are crystals leaking out of the diaper that is a user error not a manufacturing defect the crystals will only leak out if the diaper has been filled to the max and allowed to sit for some timeblow outs and leaking if it blows out the top you either need to put the diaper on tighter or move up a size the side straps will stretch and become loose as your child wears the diaper so although it may look uncomfortably tight on your child it will stretch out and keep you from having out the too blow outs i recommend stretching the side straps out as you are sticking them in place so that they wont have too much stretching leeway and result in a blow out or the diaper falling down you also need to put the straps on straight across angling them makes the diaper distort and can result in a leakif the diaper is leaking out the legs make sure to always tuck the diaper in around babys leg folds and not on the thigh this will minimize so many leaks of all kindsthese are great diapers just dont get sloppy and they will work tight waist remember the straps stretch tuck the legs in around the babys thigh rolls keep it higher in the back than the front if they consistently shoot up the back it might be time to move up a size and crystals will only leak if you arent changing the baby as often as you should,hggs little mvrs dprs step  ,11.61,0.4984894259818731,,,-239.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,110,33,99,32,190,57,152,56,0.8,0.37,0.3,0.15,1.16,0.76,110,40,39.3,37.5,0.58,0.78,5.64,7.98,0.9,21.88,0.65,0.65,23.56,3.43,0.24,0.64,0.14,0.03,0.18

B00NNZQJAO,5.0,i feel as if it would not be a complete review if i did not tell my history of having roaches these little demons have been in most houses ive lived in my entire life because my parents dont care about getting rid of them and that is something that everyone in the house needs to be a part of or at least aware of they were something that i thought was a plague on my life i literally never went a year without seeing them everywhere in my lifetime i have tried probably every spray and bug bomb on the general market nothing ever worked the sprays were more than likely ineffective because i couldnt put them as far spread as i needed to due to having pets and asthma the bug bombs require multiple applications as well as many days to clear before reentering the house and i never had a chance to be out of the house for more than a week i made a huge mistake of taking furniture with me when i moved out of my parents house so naturally the little pests came with me i considered tenting the house and everyone always told me that gels are uselessafter a year and a half of trying spray after spray after bomb of different chemicals that made me sick and i couldnt put in places in need of it because of my pets i figured what the heck i had originally gotten a pack of a small tube of gel and  baits of this brand the difference within a week was pretty outstanding with just the smaller tube and the baits i went from seeing probably  roaches a day to seeing maybe  and had carcasses everywhere i had only put it in the kitchen and there were still nests throughout the house seeing the difference it made with just the small tube i decided to order the bigger one and some bait strips of the same brandi put the gel anywhere i couldnt put a strip that my pets wouldnt get into and that i could avoid bumping into i put it under my sink in the cracks and crevices in the walls and window on top of the stove in an area that doesnt get hot it is flammable be careful i put some strips in the cabinet where i store spices and snacks always make sure you have every container sealed as best as possible roaches can squeeze into everything and you dont want them tracking the bait and the diseases they carry into your food i put this stuff virtually everywhere anywhere that i could and not worry about it i even put a few of the strips on my living room table and wrapped the areas in foil so the cats cant get into it i was really determined to get this in any place that roaches might crawl i highly suggest you do the samei bought this tube of the gel on may  and the other packages only a week or  before then i am sitting here on august  telling you this i have gone from seeing  roaches a day to recently  or  a week yes they still are going to be around they live within the walls you cant really get  rid of them especially if you live in a  year old house in florida like i do or something similar even expert exterminators will tell you this if theyre being honest however i have seen more than a  decrease in these little monsters since using this producti also highly recommend putting out some glue mouse traps in the ares that have the highest traffic it seems a bit weird but the glue on the traps acts as a bait because it is roaches favorite food and they cant resist it i put some out while using this product and they were filled within a couple of weeks i replaced them and theyre still catching a straggler here and there i even had times that had eggs hatch on them so that was a good  extra roaches that never got the chance to roam freei whole heartily recommend this product to anyone plagued with these demons as i have been it has saved what little sanity i have left i can sleep at night a little better now knowing theres not a swarm of roaches in my house anymore i am not someone that is trying to get you to waste your money or your time i did not receive a free product in exchange for my review i am someone that truly wants no one else to go through the hell i went through my entire life with these monsters i understand that all cases are different roaches are amazing little creatures and some have resistances to things that others dont at the end of the day you really arent spending much money to get this product and it has more good reviews than it does bad its worth at least trying and hopefully you have amazing results like i did,combat max roach killing gel  grams,7.93,0.4114888628370457,,,-768.95,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,254,89,232,85,509,133,423,126,0.83,0.3,0.35,0.17,4.01,1.42,254,37,41.2,41.5,0.5,0.79,7.96,11.26,0.89,24.27,0.55,0.51,34.01,4.12,0.16,0.55,0.11,0.04,0.15

B00I8YJZ4M,1.0,the toothpaste is definitely ruined by the addition of some toxic ingredients and something else you people out there dont know so this is going to be a real eye opener i have been making as a research project a medical pdf library and have almost pdfs in the dental section of the library was cavity prevention and i made another discovery you all need to hear about did you notice another ingredient in the toms toothpaste is glycerin now this is big red flag and here is why a mother can tell you her story nextlast year i bit down hard on a peanut and broke one of my molars in half right down through the root it became abscessed and i had no choice but to have it removed other than this unfortunate event i have always had good teeth i was  years old before i had my first cavity so you can see that teeth have been a nonissue for me for a long time since i went to the dentist to have my abscessed tooth removed three months ago she found  or  cavities plus gum disease this is very disturbing since i have been very good about flossing particularly careful since i was walking around for a while with a broken tooth in my mouth i found it strange that i was doing all that i was supposed to do but my mouth was worse instead of bettersince then of course i have been researching teeth several sources said that commercial toothpaste is bad because it has glycerin in it glycerin leaves a film on your teeth this film prevents remineralization of the teeth i never heard of such a thing apparently the saliva is full of minerals and will deposit those minerals in the microscopic holes and pits in the surface of the teeth caused by sugar or whatever this remineralization is a normal process that prevents the holes from becoming bigger and then becoming cavities it did not surprise me that the body had a way of fixing teeth if allowed to do so so with that being said i stopped using toothpaste and started using baking soda to brush and  to rinse i can report to you that one of the cavities is completely gone it was in a toothnext to the one that was removed so i could see it in the mirror gone looked at the tooth justtoday the others may be healing as well but i cant see them they are on the topthis is one of those things they blame on age in fact they said that to me at the dentists office since they couldnt blame smoking or lack of oral hygiene you do all the right things but your condition is worse to that i say bull it has nothing to do with age the system is in place for teeth to repair themselves but the right things get in the way of the process then you get to spend money at the dentist to be fair i want to also report that i read the comments on black walnut tincture for tooth decay i have been using it twice a day two droppers full in a small amount of water enough to swish and then swallow this could well be what turned the tide for me in addition to the good oral hygiene noted above i will continue the black walnut this is one of my victories that came straight from the earthclinic members im posting more personal stories below that prove you teeth are designed to heal themselves even if they have cavitiesi am  and last year the dentist told me i had my first cavity  it was notgoing to heal he said it was too far advanced and not possible i told him ididnt want to deal with it because i was diagnosed with stage  carcinoidcancer and had recently had surgery to cut out a tumor the thought ofcutting something else out of my body when i was working so hard to healmy body didnt make sense to me so i found your site read your tipsmade homemade remineralizing toothpaste ate a lot of bone broth and goodbutter cut down on phytic acid etci went back to the dentist  months later and he was shocked that the cavitywas gone he wanted me to tell him everything i had done i felt so goodcatherine d from virginiaanother testimony for youeverything in your body healsi had a cavity once and the
