B00DWVTZ7I,4.0,we purchased this refrigerator in february  after out  year old samsung died without being able to find very much information on the product or a comparison with the similar dcs refrigerator made by fisher  paykels sister company  on the exterior the dcs handles are thicker more robust looking and come in a choice of rounded or squared design  the f p handles are thinner and square  they are very easy to clean because unlike samsung refrigerators the handles are not curved creating tight spaces  the exterior panels of both the f p and the dcs are a smudgefree stainless that cleans very easily with soap and water  unlike our previous samsung or our bosch applianceswe love the layout the fp refrigerator has two glass shelves which slide out very easily for cleaning  there are  slots for positioning the shelves making the interior highly customizable  unlike most brands on the market the shelves are one solid piece  so the entire shelf is usable and there is no risk of something falling over and spilling between the shelves the two fruit and vegetable bins and the two chiller bins fully remove from the refrigerator for food prep and cleaning as does the plastic shelf that these bins sit in  the bins are dishwasher safe  strangely the water filter sits outside the refrigerator the dcs model has an interior water filter so we were able to set it up in the basement and feed the line up through the floor  if you dont put the filter in the basement you will need a spot to hang or sit the filter next to the refrigerator  the external water filter increases usable space in the refrigerator and makes for easy filter changingtalking about water both the f  p and the dcs models have water available in the exterior of the right refrigerator door  unlike all other refrigerator brands the water is not recessed making filling any size container or glass very easy  we routinely fill an electric kettle kuerig water tank pitchers and glasses straight from the door without any issues  unlike our old samsung which could only take certain sized glassesthe f  p and the dcs freezers are similar in layout a top sliding shelf with three clear removable bins and an open bottom drawer  the bins can be completely removed to allow trays to be stored  the bins are dishwashersafe  if the ice bin is removed the icemaker will not function until the bin is replaced the icemaker is extremely slow compared with our previous refrigerators it took several days to fill the ice bin  if additional ice is required one of the larger bins can be placed under the icemaker which is a nice feature  a small ice scoop is included with the ice bucket and despite its size and shape works very well for scoping enough ice for a glass for larger amounts the entire bin full of ice can be removedthe fp model has an updown push button temperature change system on the interior right wall  unfortunately there is no way to set a specific temperature unlike the digital dcs model which allows temperature changes using an exterior panel or our old samsung we would have liked to be able to set a specific temperature instead of having to guess and make incremental changes over a period of daysthe reason this refrigerator gets four stars is simply because the f  p is extremely noisy  there are frequent loud popping cracking sounds emanating from the refrigerator as the components expand and contract  this is the noisiest appliance we have ever owned and  months later we are still bothered by the noises  unfortunately we have no idea whether the dcs would have been made of superior materials resulting in less noise  but if it is the  higher pricetag would have been worth itoverall the manufacturer really thought out the design of this refrigerator and we highly recommend it  but take a look at the dcs model if it is available before making a decision,fisher paykel   activesmart french door refrigerator,340.54,0.45535714285714285,,,-610.61,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,221,90,205,86,412,165,347,161,0.84,0.46,0.41,0.23,3.61,1.34,221,38,40.7,39.3,0.54,0.77,7.7,10.89,0.9,25.28,0.59,0.76,41.07,4.53,0.16,0.49,0.16,0.04,0.2

B0006GVNOA,5.0,this review is for gardus  linteater  rotary dryer vent cleaning systemweve been paying  per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every  months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wallwe knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didnt dry very well and right near the end when it really needed cleaning there would actually be water on the floor under the dryeri had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came i watched the process and thought i should be doing this if thats all it isi did my research linteater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase youve got to love amazon primelike with any product you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones the bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didnt read the manual or watch youtube videos to get an idea of how the process worksthe pictures of the twisted rod someone had one of more of these speed too high clutch too high or didnt use a clutched drill at all pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipedisconnected or broke in the vent pipe the rods cant come apart if you run the drill only clockwise thats simple physics they simply cant come apart if you use clockwise only the brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod speed too high clutch too high or didnt use a clutched drill at all pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe clockwise only for both going into and back out of the vent tube my cordless drill is a ridgid model   the clutch goes from  to  it has a switch marked    for overall speed i set the clutch to four and the speed to one youre not drilling holes or driving screws youre not going as hard and fast as you can slow and easy wins this particular race i put red loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod and to the set screw as i added each section i tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section then i wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections this is all just common sense insurance against disaster the female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck arent knurled but i had no problem with them spinning in the chuck slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issuenote i didnt think id need the extra rod extensions but i do and came back to order them to get this done for now i had to do half from inside the house and half from outside inside the house vent pipe disconnected from the dryer i used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a ridgid  shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert this worked fantastically well i had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint outside the house i didnt bother with the vacuum figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly turn the dryer on to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go,gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.46709470304975925,,,-535.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,208,80,197,78,372,140,333,137,0.9,0.41,0.38,0.23,4.55,1.51,208,44,43.3,39.8,0.56,0.81,7.63,10.78,0.9,26.17,0.59,0.61,33.14,4.07,0.16,0.6,0.12,0.05,0.17
B002C8HR9A,4.0,works great  with a few exceptions dont get me wrong we totally enjoy our wonderwash its a really fun way to do small loads of laundry  of course were in our  so perhaps not everyone will agree my review is based upon the wonderwash usage as a sole washing machine for typical laundry this means that for several months we only used the wonderwash for every item that would fit and did not have another washing machine i dont think the product design holds up to that standard if it were just for campingtreks it would have  starsprosthe handcrank is very easy to use  despite the actual weight when the washers full spinning  tumbling is exceptionally easy so major points for thoughtful engineering thereits much more efficient than a traditional washing machine dont even worry about your water bill because youre barely using anything if youre an apartment dweller like me though you have had to deal with coinoperated washers and watch your money disappear not with the wonder wash yes its money upfront but our family recouped that money within months and has saved hundreds on laundryclothes seem to genuinely get cleaner than with a traditional machine this is entirely subjective and only an observation on my end  our denims washed with the wonderwash instead of through our coinop laundry seemed to be genuinely cleaner the fabric was more pliable pants were more comfortable and everything put through seemed to be cleanerconsload size is very small i would purchase a redesigned product again if it were  as large that would of course necessitate a swap to a heavier frame eg stainless steel but would be worth it with an overall time of  minutes per load i cant recommend this for anyone with a kid that hasnt learned how to pee in a toilet vs whatever she happens to be wearing luckily were past that stage now but the wonderwash got beaten to bits from extremely heavy use another pro it held up greatthe watertight seal on the lid proved to be not watertight it held up for the very first load but all subsequent loads it simply leaked now from what my knowledge is that lack of watertight seal meant a loss of pressure which meant less efficient washing thats true but ours worked pretty well for what we expected out of it if i were to purchase this product again it would have to have a redesigned seal system that holds up past the first use the frame is not built heavily enough its a lightweight plastic frame that you assemble using plugs which are prone to fall out during usage we lost a few of those plugs just from standard usage because of the frames weight disadvantage when its fully loaded it does seem to sway side to side and be affected by the rotation of the bin if i was going to purchase it again i would need to have something like a lightweight steel or more overbuilt plastic frame,the laundry alternative wonderwash nonelectric portable compact mini washing machine,5.6,0.5059523809523809,,,-423.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,187,70,169,68,309,94,250,92,0.81,0.37,0.37,0.18,2.12,1.03,187,41,42.7,40.8,0.61,0.83,7.52,10.64,0.91,28.42,0.68,0.69,32.49,4.03,0.19,0.68,0.16,0.06,0.22

B01E4RUUQI,5.0,the machine itself is amazing and cleans stuff really well i had to use the reviews here and youtube to figure out how to work it because my instructions had been translated from italian and never really corrected the pictures were pretty unhelpful too so ill share what i learnedstore this close to the kitchen sink for easier access the cord is short so invest in an extension cord of some sort you will absolutely need to fill this from a sink so be prepared for that its also bigger than you think probably and weighs  empty im disabled and its difficult for me to carry so i have to scoot it everywhere so keep the size and weight in mind im about  foot and this comes up to my stomach and is about as wide abouts two of me so its about the size of a full machineyou have to fill it from the back the detached hose connects to one of two of the small circular bits in the back the one for the washer is just that for the rinse and wash cycles the one for the dryer im told helps get suds out of clothes but i have no idea how that would drain to eventually dry clothes so i dont use it instead i keep using rinse cycles until the clothes are totally cleantheres a small metal ring that comes with this meant to clamp the larger end of the fill hose to the sink faucet if yours is anything like mine good luck getting any of that to work youll have to invest in an adapter take the hose with you to a real physical store so you can find a proper fit instead of trying to figure it out online youll save yourself so much troublethe hose that gets the dirty water out should probably feed into a large bucket of at least  gallons its hard for the machine to pump it all up to the sink so youll have an easier time with the bucket invest in some kind of very flat absorbent kitchen rug to put the machine on because water will drip no matter how careful you are plus itll keep the machine from shaking everywhere when you try to dry thingsput your laundry in one piece at a time to minimize tangling a tangled mess keeps the washer from rotating properly also be careful to fill the dryer only about half full otherwise anger will possess your machine and it will shake across your kitchen and generally be a horrible nightmare of noise and movement the spin mechanism also needs to rest after so many cycles to keep it from burning out so if your laundry isnt spinning turn the machine off for about  or so minutes before coming back to it not as convenient as a regular machine but the safety feature keeps you from messing up your machine accidentlyfor especially dirty clothes like muddy work clothes my husband is in construction rinse the clothes at about  drain the dirty water because it will probably be close to black and then wash at max time with your detergent of choice then follow up by a drain and rinse at  because the water will again be nasty and the rinse helps get suds out you might need a couple of wash or rinse cycles for especially gross clothes then load the dryer a bit at a time hanging up clothes that are mostly dry because the machine wont get them totally done since its just spin and no heatregular dirty clothes can be washed like normal but will need a rinse cycle because of suds and dont forget to put delicates on gentle with bras in a lingerie bagthats all i can think of for now i recommend reading the instructions anyway because theres some useful information like keeping your machine on a sturdy level surface and whatnot ill try to post photos later of what mine looks like set up in my kitchen in case what ive said wasnt clear,della compact twin tub portable mini washing machine washer and dryer cycle  with builtin pump,16.8,0.4310850439882698,,,-595.38,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,220,77,199,75,393,117,321,111,0.82,0.35,0.35,0.24,5.32,1.63,220,42,44.5,42.2,0.56,0.83,7.85,11.1,0.9,26.71,0.62,0.68,42.24,4.6,0.19,0.62,0.14,0.05,0.19

B0006GVNOA,5.0,this review is for gardus  linteater  rotary dryer vent cleaning systemweve been paying  per visit for the service guy from the appliance store to come every  months and clean the flexible duct thats routed in a less than optimal manner due to location and a variety of road blocks from the dryer to the outside wallwe knew the time was coming for a cleaning when clothes didnt dry very well and right near the end when it really needed cleaning there would actually be water on the floor under the dryeri had to use some vacation days or lose them and was recently at home for the first time when he came i watched the process and thought i should be doing this if thats all it isi did my research linteater is pretty clearly the way to go and made my purchase youve got to love amazon primelike with any product you have weigh the number of positive reviews against the handful of bad ones the bad reviews are likely from people who are mechanically challenged or didnt read the manual or watch youtube videos to get an idea of how the process worksthe pictures of the twisted rod someone had one of more of these speed too high clutch too high or didnt use a clutched drill at all pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipedisconnected or broke in the vent pipe the rods cant come apart if you run the drill only clockwise thats simple physics they simply cant come apart if you use clockwise only the brush head broke or stripped out is going to be like the twisted rod speed too high clutch too high or didnt use a clutched drill at all pushed against an impassable bend or obstruction on the vent pipe clockwise only for both going into and back out of the vent tube my cordless drill is a ridgid model   the clutch goes from  to  it has a switch marked    for overall speed i set the clutch to four and the speed to one youre not drilling holes or driving screws youre not going as hard and fast as you can slow and easy wins this particular race i put red loctite thread locker on the threads attaching the rotary brush head to the rod and to the set screw as i added each section i tightened them against each other with a pair of pliers on each section then i wrapped electrical tape a couple times around the joined sections this is all just common sense insurance against disaster the female ends of the rod that go into the drill chuck arent knurled but i had no problem with them spinning in the chuck slow speed and minimal torque are probably why this was not an issuenote i didnt think id need the extra rod extensions but i do and came back to order them to get this done for now i had to do half from inside the house and half from outside inside the house vent pipe disconnected from the dryer i used the vent insert in the vent pipe end with a ridgid  shop vac and the cleaning tool rod through the provided hole in the insert this worked fantastically well i had to clean the vac filter a couple times due to all the lint outside the house i didnt bother with the vacuum figuring the birds would get whatever lint they found or the elements would just break it down pretty quickly turn the dryer on to blow out the loosened lint as you clean the pipe wear googles or something to keep the lint dust out of your eyes and off you go,gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.46709470304975925,,,-535.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,208,80,197,78,372,140,333,137,0.9,0.41,0.38,0.23,4.55,1.51,208,44,43.8,39.7,0.56,0.81,7.63,10.78,0.9,26.17,0.59,0.61,33.14,4.07,0.16,0.6,0.12,0.05,0.17

B0014CN8Y8,5.0,i just purchased a new dryer and was getting very angry because it was taking a long time to dry literally hours assuming it was not the dryer after much research i came across this cleaning system and all i can say is what a difference  i had the dryer vents cleaned professionally a few years ago for a cost of  and after using this tool i realized that they only cleaned half the venti live in a  story with the dryer on the  floor which means that the vent goes in behind the wall up through the attic and through the roof well i did exactly what the professionals did and that was go through the inside vent and up and removed a lot of lint buildup but the dryer was still not drying in less than an hour i ended up on the roof and cleaned the vent from the top down which removed the clog and the end result less than  minutes to dry most loadsi followed the directions to the t and had no problems everything worked perfectly and im extremely happy the hardest part of this whole job aside from getting onto the roof was putting the foil vent back onto the dryer and the wall ventnotes be sure to use the big tall brush first and then the small wider brush ie you need to do  passes to really clean the vent make sure to use the drill you cannot just use the brush and rods the drill actually rotates the brush to break up the lint and allow it to fall maybe if i had purchased the extensions i would not have had to go on the roof but theres no way that i could clear the entire vent with the  rods  feet if working on the inside of the house its important to wear a mask because all that lint and dust will come down follow the directions and tape the rods after connecting together, gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.5075075075075075,,,-241.15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,120,30,111,29,194,51,167,50,0.86,0.3,0.25,0.12,0.73,0.61,120,39,41.3,41.3,0.62,0.79,6.09,8.62,0.91,25.09,0.66,0.63,19.61,3.13,0.19,0.61,0.13,0.09,0.22

B00NESZL22,2.0,really wanting this weather station and its wireless sensors to work but encountered too many issues  i bought this weather station with two wireless sensors  first one of the sensors could not be set to channel  while can be set to any other channel  second the main units temperature reading was stuck around the high temp of the day until sometime pass midnight everyday  its stuck such that the second floors sensors reading was lower than the main unit on the first floor  i took the outside sensor and placed it next to the main unit after about  minutes the sensors temp reading was a few degrees lower than the main unit  third the relative humidity on one of the wireless sensor was stuck on  while the main unit the other wireless sensor and my thermostats all reported about   one other small complaint is that the ac connector plugging into the main unit should bend  degrees  its fine if the outlet is on the same side as the ac connector if not the connector sticks out a couple of inches with the wire running to the opposite side  the features are what i wanted but the accuracy claimed is quite questionable  the whole thing will definitely be sent back though im not sure if i want a replacement or look for something else,ambient weather  wireless weather station with temperature humidity barometer dew point moon phase featuring color changing backlighting,1.41,0.547085201793722,,,-137.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,81,24,75,24,137,38,118,38,0.86,0.32,0.3,0.19,0.96,0.69,81,37,37.4,34.4,0.59,0.71,4.89,6.92,0.89,20.0,0.64,0.81,16.96,2.91,0.18,0.59,0.18,0.03,0.2

B001R1U6X2,5.0,i can do a direct comparison with the cigar oasis and hydra lg since i just bought both recently i initially bought the cigar oasis plus and then thisthe cigar oasis no way to run extra fans on the new models as the ribbon cable and power ports have changed and no longer compatible with hydra fan kits no audible alarm otherwise works well and constructed well both at china made so not super quality but both comparablehydralg i wanted the hydra small but it was not available from amazon directly and i like buying directly from amazon so i bought the large glad i did its pretty big so i have to take out a bottom shelf you need minimum  height i bought the hydra as i wanted to run two extra fans to circulate the air humidity rises and i had quite a difference from top to bottom i love the fact that you have a choice to run the fans continuously or only when the hydra humi fans come on i opted for the second option for now i love the remote with display also the fact that there is a onoff button which cigar oasis does not its very sensitive and comes on quickly and silently i did have to calibrate it a little it was showing  higher humidity and it was easy to calibrate i just put it next to my extect calibrated pshycrometer and adjusted after a whilei placed the two extra fans on the second top shelf in the back at an  angle one pushing air down and other up for now they are working well i will adjust things as needed so my vote is for the hydra and dont waste your money on cigar oasis for a large humidor lets hope it lastslastly the cigar oasis build quality seems slightly better than hydra and the sensor is easily recognized on the co on the hydra no idea where the sensor is i called support and they didnt know either at least hydra has a support number to call co has no support number to call,hydralg commercial series electronic humidifier,4.58,0.5056497175141242,,,-270.92,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,128,47,116,45,226,74,193,72,0.85,0.37,0.37,0.17,1.5,0.87,128,40,39.0,39.0,0.57,0.79,6.02,8.51,0.9,22.45,0.6,0.61,20.17,3.18,0.17,0.56,0.13,0.07,0.2

B00DM8KXUO,3.0,i ordered the  door closer kit because the refrigerator and freezer doors both made loud pops when opened and closed on my whirlpool gold model  sidebyside refrigeratorfreezer which was manufactured in january   we have probably had it since   i removed the water filter and the kick plate  after emptying the refrigerator door of food i removed the upper hinge and then lifted the door off the bottom hinge there did not appear to be a lot of wear on the upper or lower cam and neither had any cracks  i replaced the upper cam and screw that were attached to the bottom of the door from the kit without any problems  then i began to replace the lower cam although i could not distinguish between the cam provided loosely in the kit bag and the cam contained in its individual bag within the kit bag that was labeled   i decided to use the unlabeled cam  however i did notice when removing the lower cam that the screw retaining the cam was loose and that the cam could be moved slightly  i replaced the cam and the new screw from the kit  i also lubricated both cams with a synthetic lubricant  i rehung the door and reattached the upper hinge  when i opened and closed the door the popping sound was gonethen i removed food from the freezer door  i removed the upper hinge and found that my refrigeratorfreezer had no wiring at the upper hinge like that i had seen on a youtube video  i disconnected the water line at the lower hinge and two electrical connectors that also passed through the lower hinge  while my wife guided the water line and electrical cable i lifted the door off the lower hinge  here i discovered a major problem  the openings in the upper and lower cam for my freezer door were much larger than those of any cams supplied in the kit  there did not seem to be a great deal of wear on either cam and there were no cracks  but i did discover that the screw holding the lower cam was loose and that the cam could be moved slightly like that on the refrigerator door  since i did not have the proper cams i tightened the loose screw lubed the cams replaced the door with my wife guiding the water line and electrical cable through the lower hinge and reattached the upper hinge  when i opened and closed the door there was no poppingso im not sure i really need this kit at all  i certainly did not for the freezer door  if you check your cams and find that they look to be in pretty good shape and that the screw holding the cam is not tight then you may not need this kit to get rid of popping noises when opening or closing your doors  on the other hand the kit is fairly cheap and if you remove the door and find your cams badly worn or cracked then it would be nice to have the cams on hand to complete the repair at that time  however this kit did not contain the cams required for my freezer door,whirlpool  door closer kit,8.99,0.3595505617977528,,,-453.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,125,42,115,42,321,104,274,104,0.85,0.38,0.34,0.19,2.78,1.18,125,40,35.5,34.6,0.39,0.69,4.93,6.98,0.84,15.34,0.42,0.59,28.44,3.77,0.18,0.31,0.08,0.03,0.11

B00LGUB7QY,5.0,this small coupling made the absolute easiest fix of an appliance  or anything else i have ever attempted my refrigerator stopped dispensing ice more than a year ago and when i researched the problem online i was overwhelmed by all the things that can go wrong with an ice dispenserand i just let it go and satisfied myself with opening the freezer door and shoveling the ice out manually then i began to get curious and test out things and decided that i either needed an auger motor or this couplingor both the motor actually was working but it was making an odd noise so i ordered both  i found the auger motor for my refrigerator model much cheaper online somewhere else as it turns out all that was wrong with my ice dispenser assembly was the coupler which was stripped out and simply slipped around on the threaded shaft that the motor uses to turn the auger in the ice bucket which moves the ice to the dispenser most of the help videos showed that i would have to remove the auger motor and perform some kind of mcgyver to get the darn coupler off since it was stripped out but lo and behold i learned on one of the forums discussing ice dispenser problems and fixes that if your coupler was not jammed on if it was stripped out like mine and would not move backward or forward in order to be removed from the shaftall you have to do is install a new one right in front of it unplug fridge remove ice container and by hand screw this lefthanded coupler on replace ice container plug in refrigerator and you are good to go if the coupler is the problem it has been two weeks since i did this fix and my dispenser is working just fine with both cubed or crushed ice my refrigerator has the old style plastic auger instead of the metal one and so i probably will have to be careful from now on and make sure nothing gets jammed or the same problem will occur i didnt need the motor but i have it if i need it and i know how to change it out if i have to it is not often i get an easy fix and i certainly appreciated this one,whirlpool   motor coupling  ice maker,13.93,0.4681933842239186,,,-302.05,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,129,44,114,44,237,75,190,75,0.8,0.39,0.34,0.2,2.4,1.1,129,43,37.5,38.9,0.54,0.77,5.93,8.38,0.89,21.35,0.6,0.68,28.02,3.74,0.22,0.5,0.12,0.04,0.16

product but unfortunately it didnt work out for metldr version of reviewit does do a basic wash of your clothes but the construction of the device is questionable rating this three stars because the device gets out some but not all of the dirt doesnt seem like its built to last and has many parts dont even fit together correctly arguably the axle is the most mechanically important component of the washer since thats the mechanism by which the whole thing works but unfortunately the axle could not be securely positioned on my unit due to poorly constructed fittings also if it matters to you the wonder wash is indeed pinkoh and this doesnt affect my rating but if you were considering using this in an apartment dont just think about the money you might save also consider the time it will take to wash repeated loads the space this will take up in your apartment especially if you live in a city and the space your drying rack will take up in your apartment and if youre doing a lot of loads the whole laundry setup will be a permanent fixture if youre not doing a lot of loads youll have to clear out space every time youre doing laundry and then move everything back when youre donedepending on your situation and lifestyle choices you may find that the time and space savings you get from going to the laundromat are worth more to you than the money saved from having your own manual washer long version of review before you read all the rest of this i want to be clear in stating that i did look at the other reviews and online manuals for the wonder wash so i am fairly certain that i assembled and used the machine correctlyassembly is pretty obvious even if you dont look at the instructions since there is basically only one configuration that makes sense for each partand when washing i added the recommended amounts of warm water and detergent turned for the recommended amount of cycles and made sure to turn slowly enough to hear a thunk on each half turn to indicate that the water and clothes actually moved in the unitgood stuff the action of washing with the wonderwash does not take long five minutes or less if we only count the time spent cranking the barrel it seems to at least partially clean laundry the wash water was greyish and somewhat sudsy at the end of the wash cycle so something is definitely cleaned from the clothes but not everything see the first point in bad stuff below for more on thisbad stuff it didnt manage to clean out all the random floor crap picked up on my socks and i still had to scrub them manually to get them totally clean some people claim this can clean their totallysoiledfromoutdooradventures jeans but frankly im not seeing it while i can imagine this cleaning off dirt clay and other such things which fall apart naturally in turbulent water this isnt going to do much for you if you have things like little fluffs or splinters that have wormed their way through the weave of your socks or sweaters youll need proper agitation for that not just clothes rubbing against other clothes and smooth plastic the construction of the wonderwash parts wasnt great the wonder wash is basically a barrel that rotates along an axle supported by the stand two pins go on either side of the axle to prevent the barrel from slipping out on my unit the pins did not seem to fit quite right into the axle of the machine most irritatingly the handle did not slide all the way onto the peg it was built for which means that the pin for that side of the wonderwash could not be inserted the entire thing slid from side to side in its frame while turning this may have been because the pin did not go in all the way on one side and could not be inserted at all on the other side due to the handle covering the pinhole the top and bottom halves of the barrel are connected using tape and the tape was damaged when i got my unit i would guess that there is also some kind of adhesive on the join but the fact that there needs to be tape at all is slightly worrying if your kitchen sink has shelves next to it you might not be able to use the wonderwash on your counter it needs at least   centimeters of clearanceheight between your countertop and the bottom of your shelves unfortunately i could not use it on my shelf for this reason when placed in the bathtub or on any other nonflat surface the whole thing including the frame will move from side to side the frame itself flexes to accommodate this but i am concerned about how much stress the plastic can take with this much movement when the frame flexes the plastic inserts which hold the parts of the frame together sometimes pop out of their spots i had to stop washing to replace the inserts several times this made the process more frustrating and time consuming than necessaryannoying stuffwhich did not affect my rating as most of this is either par for course if youre signing up for a manual washer or could be seen as a plus in some situations although washing in and of itself isnt complicated or time consuming the surrounding hassle of measuring out your clothes measuring water moving everything in and out of the washer wringing or spin drying everything and hanging everything up takes a long time im sure this gets more efficient with practice and i know its also exactly what you signed up for when you get a manual washing machine but its even more time than i expected it takes at least half an hour to go through the whole process for one load you are pretty much required to buy a spin dryer and possibly a drying rack if you want to do your laundry with any level of efficiency doubly true if you cant hang clothes outdoors and dont want to damage your floors from the dripping you need to rinse many times to get the soap out one rinse wont do it perhaps using a spin dryer to spin out soapy water before rinsing could help the suction cups make it almost impossible to move the wonderwash from a flat wet surface and if you manage to lift one suction cup another one has then gotten stuck and needs to be pried off again this is a plus when actually rotating the barrel but it gets really annoying when you have to transfer the thing from one countertop to another in order to drain itconfusing stuffwhich did not affect my rating since this is mostly personal preference its pink if youve ever had some really old thing made of white plastic and it turned a light yellow all over due to age where youre not sure if your lighting is bad or if its really just yellow then thats basically the color of this device except pink instead of yellow the product seemed to be used this isnt really a problem to me in general since its a washing machine and the whole thing is going to get cleaned out over and over again anyways but i was still expecting something newadditional noteswhich did not affect my rating but might be useful to you if youre also a city dwelleri live in an urban studio without an inunit washer and dryer the community laundromat costs  for washing and  for drying at that rate i figured i could afford this washer  depending on when you got it a spin dryer  depending on make and model and a drying rack  depending on how fancy it is and whether or not you have a costco membership that would pay themselves off after two years or soi personally only bought the wonder wash for now because i wanted to first see if i would be willing to commit to manual laundry before making a significantly larger investment into a spin dryer and now im very glad that i didnt take the full plungei watched a lot of video reviews and demos of this washer and of wonderwash  spin dryer setups and everything looked so easy and great but most of the videos leave out the time it takes to move the whole setup around drain water or move the thing to over a sinktub and flip over the dang washer to empty it from the top as i did being my impatient self rinse multiple times this is often edited out of videos wring everything by hand or carefully arrange it in an optimal donut configuration in the spin dryer and finally hang everything upi realize that the whole process is more or less par for course if youre going to do things manually but i guess i just didnt think hard enough about just how much effort and space everything would take and how much that penalty would be compounded in a small urban dwelling maybe it would be reduced if it were as normal and nonleasebreaking to dry clothes on a rack outside the window in the us as it is in most other countries ive been to but as it is i have to use an indoor drying rackdoing everything in real life was so much of a hassle this is especially true for me because i couldnt do the laundry next to the kitchen sink due to the height of the barrel so i had to put the machine in the tub where the whole thing shook and started falling apart i also had to kneel on the floor outside the tub and bend over to crank the barrel which i can easily see becoming a major problem with repetition also like i said i dont have a basement garage or outdoor area to do everything in so i have to run back and forth in my little apartment to where i have the washerspin dryerdrying rack stored and cannot do everything in one placeto make it worse it turns out that the laundry facilities i currently use can fit about three times as much clothesother stuff in them compared to the wonder washer so it takes three times as much effort as i described here to get one regular load donealthough basically all of these little tasks were anticipated at the end of the day it was more trouble than i imagined with all of this in consideration along with the mechanical issues of the wonder wash unit i received i think that paying  a load and just taking the elevator up and down a few floors is way more worth it than the trouble and space expense of washing and drying everything manuallyif you live in a place where the laundromat is exceptionally expensive or far away or you just have enough space to keep a dedicated laundry area then this might be right for you but if you live in a small space with easy access to laundry facilities then you might not find manual laundry to be worth doing if youre not sure as i was then just buy the wonder wash and try it by itself before you get the full kit i guess in the worst case youll return it and someone else will get your unit and write a review saying that their unit arrived used,the laundry alternative wonderwash nonelectric portable compact mini washing

B0006GVNOA,4.0,great product but they need to include more rods in the kit i had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasnt enough so ill end up spending  dollars on this kit which isnt terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town but still its plastic rods with a brush attachedthats overpriced for something so simpleso enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review it works great if you arent an idiot and use common sense when using it  always clockwise again always clockwise i cant be anymore clear about this  use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number  above its a good safety measure so just do it it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape  feed one rod at a time taping each one as you go  dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached if you get resistance remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggleshift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things  you have a large bend in your duct or  you have a lot of blockage if its number  start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached remember to always spin  clockwise as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again i didnt disconnect rods during this step but i did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure i didnt damage the rods  once youve reached the end of your vent start pulling your rods out the same way you went in clockwise so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning  i pushed the brush through  times in total from different sides of the vent since i was short a few rods and used the leaf blower  times in between to ensure i was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house never blow the leaf blower into the house only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a huge mess in your house  lastly id recommend using a face maskrespirator mask as this stuff is messy and you dont know whats growing in it i had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time i clean it as its not fun to breath in,gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.4641350210970464,,,-384.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,154,58,139,55,276,100,237,96,0.86,0.41,0.38,0.24,4.38,1.48,154,41,41.2,38.2,0.56,0.8,6.55,9.27,0.9,23.51,0.59,0.69,35.15,4.19,0.22,0.56,0.13,0.03,0.16

B00009V3UE,4.0,i ordered these to replace the knobs on my  year old kenmore gas range made by roper  buying the brand replacements would have cost over  per knob  thats far more than the range is worth  i looked at a lot of knob reviews for different brands online before purchasing  most of them claimed that the knobs in question did not fit their range or did not fit well  guess what these did not fit on my range out of the box either  however with ingenuity and trial and error i found a work around  now the knobs are doing their job well  all you need to do is select the plastic sleeve that fits your stem the stem that protrudes from the range  when i did this and slid the knob onto the stem it would not turn since my knob must be pushed in then turned to the left to ignite the burner  if yours operates like this do what i did  i took tiny portions of a paper towel although any similar material will do and stuffed it into the knob shaft  i filled about half of it and then slid it back on the stem  success  the problem is that the stem is much shorter than the shaft so the knob slides too close to the stove to be able to push it in before turning it  hope that description makes sense and helps someone else  the only other problem is that the knobs feel like they could be slightly tighter on the stem  if that continues i plan to wrap the stem with a piece of electrical tapesome people had trouble with the circular overlays that you peel the backing from and place on the knob  its only been a couple of days but so far they are sticking  i am sure if they come loose a dose of contact cement will remedy that situation  they look nice and are functioning for a small fracdtion of what the brand knobs would have cost  i couldnt bear the thought of the knobs being worth more than the range,range kleen  gas range knobs chrome,13.68,0.5299145299145299,,,-259.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,121,36,111,36,199,59,171,59,0.86,0.35,0.3,0.17,1.53,0.87,121,36,39.5,36.1,0.61,0.73,6.07,8.58,0.91,24.46,0.65,0.64,21.81,3.3,0.2,0.61,0.12,0.04,0.16

B0014CN8Y8,5.0,important  follow the directions and remember clockwise clockwise clockwise youll understand when you see it our home is  years old and weve lived in it for  of those  years we have never cleaned the dryer ducts and were certain the previous owners wouldve had no need to do so our washer went out a week ago and so we decided to replace the dryer as well the dryer had never been moved in  years and when i went to unhook it i was amazed that the connecting pipe was almost completely clogged with lint we clean our dryer lint collector every time we use it so it got me to thinking  if theres this much lint in the connecting pipe how much lint is in the main pipe that i cant see so in anticipation of getting a new washer and dryer set i decided to look into ways of checking into this and came across this productour vent pipe is  feet long and a  degree bend  the way down well thats where this awesome tool comes in i was a bit nervous about it until i got it this thing is made very well and i had no issues with it at all i followed the directions and made sure that i   duct taped the joints  made sure my drill was set to clockwise  went slow and steady and didnt force anything the directions are very important cause if you do not follow them you could find yourself in trouble i recommend that you have a  gallon shop vac with the  hose to help you with this job the vac will help in declogging the pipe by sucking the lint as you loosen it i could not believe how much lint came out of our pipes i had to unclog the vac hose like  times because there was so much volume amazing to think that there was so much lint that it clogged up my  gallon pro shop vac  times the main thing is to go slow theres no need to put your drill on high if you dont have a variable speed drill  i recommend you get one you may get yourself into trouble if your drill only runs in super fast mode because should you run into a snag you could break the rods inside your duct can you imagine that therefore have the right tools for the job and follow the directions to the letter cause you dont want that to happendue to our  foot run i bought  kits rather than buy the extention set because to me for a few bucks more why not have extra brushes etc too the tool assembles with ease and i loved the shop vac attachment tool it came with it made this job sooooooo much easierbottom line   i love this tool it did exactly what i wanted it to do and it did it with ease and sure beat paying someone to do it i was completely done in about  hr for a  foot pipe and i have more airflow from our dryer than ever before take a look at some of the pics some people have posted with their lint because this is exactly what i experienced i removed approx  pounds of lint which is a considerable amount when you think about it our pipes are clean and i can relax in the knowledge that weve increased the life of our new dryer exponentially and removed the risk for a duct fire totally worth every cent to buy this tool in my book , gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.4151260504201681,,,-507.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,170,56,152,54,348,98,293,96,0.84,0.33,0.33,0.17,2.89,1.2,170,37,41.5,38.2,0.49,0.74,6.44,9.11,0.88,20.76,0.52,0.55,30.25,3.89,0.19,0.51,0.09,0.02,0.12

B0053F9V20,1.0,we bought this kit to replace a broken door balance link string  this kit containing two links and two improved design guide pulleys was actually less expensive than a single link string  the improved design of the guide bracket uses a pulley at the bottom pulley and the top guide the oem had a pulley on the bottom and a fixed guide at the top  seems like a good idea right  i thought so too  actually this pulley at the top that is intended to reduce friction of the string sliding on the oem fixed guide squeaks unbearably loud when the tensioned string puts pressure on it and the plastic pulley rotates on its plastic shaft  another reviewer actually posted a video review showing how loud it is  i didnt believe them and now am sorry i didnt  it really is that loud  without pressure on the pulley it spins smoothly freely and silently but add the pressure of the tensioned door balance string and wow does the plasticonplastic rotation make a terribly loud noise  whats really odd is that the bottom pulley spins smoothly freely and silently even with the pressure on it  and its the same as the top pulley  cant figure it outcombine this with the fact that although this item is supposed to be compatible with our dishwasher model kitchenaid   it is not  the string is  inches shorter than the oem  thats nearly   this is not an exaggeration  i even moved the pulley to the closest setting gaining about  inch and it was still too much tension on the spring  i feared it would fly off at any second  and decided not to chance it  save your time and headaches and do not try to use this kit with a kitchenaid dishwasher  we are back to square one and have to live with a heavy dooras for seneca river trading i have nothing bad to say about them  they shipped fast and safely  i have contacted them and am waiting to hear on a resolution  hopefully they come through  so in a nutshell i have no complaints at this time with seneca river trading just with the item  do not use on a kitchenaid,whirlpool  door balance link kit for dish washer,13.4,0.47554347826086957,,,-285.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,130,51,121,49,223,87,190,85,0.85,0.45,0.39,0.24,2.63,1.15,130,33,40.5,38.8,0.58,0.78,6.16,8.71,0.9,23.53,0.64,0.89,36.54,4.27,0.22,0.56,0.13,0.07,0.21

B00VC55Y08,5.0,i was wondering how long the upper rack adjusters would last on my whirlpoolmade kenmore dishwasher after comparing them to my moms older kenmore dw which was also made by whirlpool  i got my answer last month   years for me  a littler research online revealed that the breakage of this part is a huge problem  the achilles heel of the original parts design is the dainty wheel axles that are part of the plastic mold of the adjusters bracket  over time in the harsh dw environment these pieces which have to bear the weight of the dishes in the upper rack become brittle and eventually break  its not a matter of if it will break but rather when  shame on whirlpool for putting such garbage on consumersluckily i happened upon a video that showed this upgraded adjuster kit which really is very similar if not the same as the adjuster used prior to the one that came in the machine  there were a few helpful videos that show how to remove the old adjusters and put on the new ones  its a rather easy lowcost fix and anyone can do it without incurring the costs of a repairman  there is absolutely no reason to buy the original adjusters which are virtually the same price as this one  they really need to stop selling the old one so that unwary consumers dont waste money on themthe dishwasher is back to working as normal  actually its better than when new as the upper rack used to squeal like an oiled pig at a county fair from when it was practically new  the wheels of the new adjuster roll much more smoothly in the tracks without all the racket  the parts of this adjuster are notably heavier than the original ones as the brackets are constructed of heavy gauge metal  my moms machine is  years old and never had any issues so i believe this new adjuster will last the life of the machine without further complaint  if i were to have anything negative to say its that this adjuster intrudes slightly more into the rack  so i have to place smaller glasses next to it than before  obviously this is a minor nit but something i immediately noticed,whirlpool  rack  black,22.0,0.5319148936170213,,,-293.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,144,51,133,50,220,70,186,69,0.85,0.37,0.35,0.18,1.06,0.73,144,40,42.3,42.6,0.65,0.83,6.86,9.71,0.92,29.81,0.72,0.88,26.47,3.64,0.16,0.69,0.15,0.07,0.22

B000BQUF44,3.0,i got this kit to replace an old copper line to our ice maker that had cracked and sustained a pin hole leak  i got it installed fine but it took me about an hour of messing with the compression fittings to realize they just wouldnt get tight enough to hold the tubing in place  the compression fittings seem to have a built in sleeve that no matter how hard i tightened would not crush down on the line to secure it in place like it should  finally i went to the hardware store and replaced these with the compression fittings that use the nylon ferrules to crush down on the tube and lock it in place and it worked just fine  i believe this is the reason there are several reviews stating the kit leaks at both ends so make sure you either replace the fittings or after installing them give a nice tug on the tube before you turn the water back on to ensure it is in fact secured in place,watts  polyethylene icemaker kit ,12.95,0.6149425287356322,58.0,9.157894736842104,-79.76,174,1,32,19,3,16,3,3,19,174.0,58.0,9.1579,19.0,10.6667,6.3333,0.8421,5.3333,3.0,1.0,1.0,0.1579,6.3333,1.0,68,23,63,23,97,33,89,33,0.92,0.37,0.34,0.24,1.94,0.98,68,41,40.3,40.4,0.7,0.82,4.88,6.9,0.92,25.59,0.71,0.79,20.48,3.2,0.29,0.64,0.08,0.04,0.12

B00AMF7X2G,3.0,first of all this is something you dont want to mickey mouse  i made this mod for my daughters gas dryer and safety was my top concern  i found the recommended procedure difficult  there are sharp edges and didnt see how one could get a good seal with the duct tape by reaching through the holes in the dryer side and back  regarding the kit itself the piece that connects to the blower outlet and the  degree piece fit well  however the piece that goes from the  degree and out the side of the dryer was a loose fit and when pushed firmly into the  degree piece ends up being too short  the duct ends up being flush with the side of the dryer  because of the difficulty and danger of the recommended procedure and because the dryer needed a cleaning anyway i opted to disassemble the dryer removing the front and drum  more work but much less frustration  im glad i did because there was quite a bit of lint inside and i was able to assemble and tape the duct work securely  with the drum out you can easily assemble and tape the three pieces of duct work together and install it as one piece  but test fit the duct work before taping  as i mentioned the piece of duct that came with the kit that is supposed to go out the side of the dryer was too short  i decided to cut the original rear duct piece and use that which worked perfectly  tip  much easier to cut the duct work with tin snips than hacksaw  obviously you need real duct tape the shiny stuff  to complete the job i had ordered a pair of good clamps whirlpool vent clamps and flexible dryer duct dundas jafine proflex from amazon  in summary if you are determined to do the side vent conversion then despite the high price and short duct piece i think you should get the kit since it allows the duct to be secured to the dryer frame with a screw and you end up with a safe dryer and peace of mind,lg electronics  dryer side or bottom venting kit,81.12,0.48739495798319327,,,-273.97,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,129,47,115,46,213,73,183,72,0.86,0.39,0.36,0.24,2.69,1.16,129,45,40.3,39.4,0.61,0.81,6.25,8.84,0.91,24.89,0.63,0.84,32.09,4.01,0.21,0.51,0.14,0.04,0.18

B0002HMUBI,3.0,this is really nothing more than a taste filter  it does a pretty good job of making los angeles water taste good  i use this to run to the water and ice maker in my fridgehowever doing an actual water test it does not remove a lot of the dissolved solids and mineralsthe overall system is fairly well made  it is easy to change filters and you do not have to turn of the water to do so as the filter head features an auto shut off when the filter is removedhowever the attachment to the wall is a single screw and the connectors for the water lines are not as robust as i might like friction fit essentially  but then it is all plastic and not brass this is probably better to use with plastic water line as the flexibility of the plastic line should reduce stress at the fitting i of course am using copper line and thus my concern over the robustness of the fittings,ge smartwater inline filter system gxrlq,37.98,0.5892857142857143,168.0,9.882352941176471,-82.13,168,1,23,17,1,10,1,3,21,168.0,168.0,9.8824,17.0,23.0,17.0,0.5882,10.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.1765,21.0,1.2353,68,23,60,22,105,29,86,28,0.82,0.33,0.34,0.1,0.2,0.32,68,36,37.6,38.2,0.65,0.72,4.69,6.64,0.91,21.65,0.7,0.65,8.45,2.06,0.15,0.67,0.12,0.08,0.2

B00NESZL22,4.0,marvelous  weve triedtested several different devices for indooroutdoor temperature  humidity see my other reviews and this one stands out among them for its features especially ease of use ease of viewing and having the right info in the right placethe plussesits easy to read from a distance it properly puts temperature first then humidity includes a barometer and a graph of pressure for the past  hours so you can see if weather is getting fairer or not and has a moon phase display which is great for those who enjoy stargazingyou can also cycle the  graph through for indooroutdoor temperature and humidity toowe got this one because it has humidity calibration you can alter the display  a certain amount  however weve found both temp and humidity quite accurate  that was gauged by comparing it to a set of regular thermometers and other gauges and to itself  you put the sensor next to the device indoors and see if the indooroutdoor readings matchthe backlit colors are great too giving one a feel for the outside temperature by color codeone big plus this operates off both electricity and battery  best to leave it plugged in  the cord is long enough to put it on a tablea pro and a connow the display is bright  thats great for seeing and reading it but at night the light is almost blindingly bright so much so that youll think someone has left a light on in the room its in  ok no problem as the top button can be pressed to turn off the light then in the morning you can turn it on againa negativehowever pressing that top button takes a fair amount of pressure and you have to hold it down for a couple of seconds to turn the display on more than momentarily  this worked fine for us until this morning when the kickstand broke off and the device slid off the table and crashed to the floor  turns out that the kickstand is attached to the back only with two tiny plastic pieces that are easily broken offits a real shame as it means the unit can no longer be propped up on its own for viewing  we had a spare inexpensive plastic minieasel that works though it looks poor aestheticallythe moral of this story is to use  hands to turn on the backlight one to hold the unit and the other to press the top button  otherwise the pressure is transmitted directly to the kickstand and it will eventually break off as it did to usin any event other than that it is a good product and now occupies the central place in our corral of indooroutdoor devices,ambient weather  wireless weather station with temperature humidity barometer dew point moon phase featuring color changing backlighting,1.41,0.5200892857142857,,,-366.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,169,63,149,61,253,83,214,81,0.85,0.38,0.37,0.28,4.82,1.55,169,44,44.6,41.9,0.67,0.87,7.51,10.62,0.93,32.96,0.7,0.7,29.4,3.83,0.2,0.72,0.14,0.05,0.2

B00FN898HU,1.0,really disappointed in this product i bought it in late  after reading a few reviews i couldnt find many details on the product online from the manufacturer so i really only had the amazon reviews to go from i rarely take the time to write detailed reviews but am in this case in hope that it helps someone not make the same mistakeyes i know the product is very inexpensive and made in china i knew i was in for a cheaperthanusual vent hood but this was far below my expectations based on the reviews and photos i wish id forked over another  to buy a quality rangepreface this was installed by two people  a skilled contractor and one of his crew members the lights are led but they are blue not cool white that has a blue tint they are full on electric blue absolutely hated it and i couldnt even stand to turn them on lights after circulation of course are the second main use for an overrange vent the lights are actually built into the hood so there is not an option swap them out you could probably rewire it and trust me i considered this but there are no screws that allow you to disassemble the top part that slides up and down to allow you to customize the height from the ceiling this piece is incredibly flimsy the metal is thin and easily bent there was a visible eyesore of  gap between the top of the shroud and the ceiling our ceiling drywall is level so that wasnt the problem there is not a way to screw or attach this sliding piece to the bottom shroud you really have to be able to slide it up and down during the install in order to attach the vent pipe from the ceiling it it is not hardwired our contractor thought that was odd having to plug this in while installing and trying to simultaneously get the flexible vent pipe from the ceiling inserted into the hole properly attached was quite a feat the plug kept falling out and does not stay in we had to take the entire thing down more than once just to plug it back in over a few months the plug began to just lean out of the socket and worked its way out the ground prong actually broke off you dont want to install a nongrounded appliance that draws this amount of power so we were going to have to change the plugthis thing is more hassle than its worth save your money until you can get a quality hood from a vendor that carries a warranty its vague as to how or if that was possible with this thing i am not about to pay shipping to return this for another one,golden vantage  wall mount range hood  stainless steel vent hood,39.19,0.4957627118644068,,,-382.23,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,169,65,157,64,269,88,218,87,0.81,0.4,0.38,0.25,4.56,1.51,169,38,41.4,39.8,0.63,0.79,7.29,10.3,0.92,29.25,0.72,0.76,41.07,4.53,0.25,0.69,0.15,0.06,0.21

B0006GVNOA,4.0,great product but they need to include more rods in the kit i had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasnt enough so ill end up spending  dollars on this kit which isnt terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town but still its plastic rods with a brush attachedthats overpriced for something so simpleso enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review it works great if you arent an idiot and use common sense when using it  always clockwise again always clockwise i cant be anymore clear about this  use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number  above its a good safety measure so just do it it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape  feed one rod at a time taping each one as you go  dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached if you get resistance remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggleshift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things  you have a large bend in your duct or  you have a lot of blockage if its number  start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached remember to always spin  clockwise as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again i didnt disconnect rods during this step but i did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure i didnt damage the rods  once youve reached the end of your vent start pulling your rods out the same way you went in clockwise so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning  i pushed the brush through  times in total from different sides of the vent since i was short a few rods and used the leaf blower  times in between to ensure i was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house never blow the leaf blower into the house only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a huge mess in your house  lastly id recommend using a face maskrespirator mask as this stuff is messy and you dont know whats growing in it i had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time i clean it as its not fun to breath in,gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.4641350210970464,,,-384.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,154,58,139,55,276,100,237,96,0.86,0.41,0.38,0.24,4.38,1.48,154,41,42.1,39.6,0.56,0.8,6.55,9.27,0.9,23.51,0.59,0.69,35.15,4.19,0.22,0.56,0.13,0.03,0.16

B0006GVNOA,4.0,great product but they need to include more rods in the kit i had to buy a second set of rods and that still wasnt enough so ill end up spending  dollars on this kit which isnt terrible if you factor what you would get charged out in town but still its plastic rods with a brush attachedthats overpriced for something so simpleso enough of me complaining about it being overpriced and get to the review it works great if you arent an idiot and use common sense when using it  always clockwise again always clockwise i cant be anymore clear about this  use electrical tape or duct tape as a backup in case you screw up on number  above its a good safety measure so just do it it only takes a few seconds per rod to wrap in tape  feed one rod at a time taping each one as you go  dont force the rods if you get resistance with the drill attached if you get resistance remove the drill from the rod and using your hands wiggleshift the rods until you get past the resistance and then reconnect the drill and continue most likely if you reach resistance is likely one of two things  you have a large bend in your duct or  you have a lot of blockage if its number  start pulling the rod out with or without the drill attached if the drill remains attached remember to always spin  clockwise as youve probably hit a patch of lint clogged heavily in one area pulling the rod out will likely pull a large portion of lint youve broken loose out with the rod and brush  attachment so vacuum it up or blow it out if you have a leaf blower and then start again i didnt disconnect rods during this step but i did take my time to hand feed the rod and brush back in to ensure i didnt damage the rods  once youve reached the end of your vent start pulling your rods out the same way you went in clockwise so that you catch any debris you might have missed on the initial cleaning  i pushed the brush through  times in total from different sides of the vent since i was short a few rods and used the leaf blower  times in between to ensure i was pushing any lint to the exterior of the house never blow the leaf blower into the house only blow to the outside of the house unless you want a huge mess in your house  lastly id recommend using a face maskrespirator mask as this stuff is messy and you dont know whats growing in it i had some cheap carpentry mask but will use a better version next time i clean it as its not fun to breath in,gardus  linteater rotary dryer vent cleaning system,29.09,0.4641350210970464,,,-384.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,154,58,139,55,276,100,237,96,0.86,0.41,0.38,0.24,4.38,1.48,154,41,42.7,39.1,0.56,0.8,6.55,9.27,0.9,23.51,0.59,0.69,35.15,4.19,0.22,0.56,0.13,0.03,0.16

B0049HE6AU,2.0,this water valve i purchased as a replacement valve for my fridge did not work properly from the start in fact it maybe responsible fordamaging my icemaker itself due to a wattage issue i did not notice until the removal and reinstall of another water valve  i had  also purchased on amazon to replace this one that did not work with my fridge that the wattage is  watts i noticed that the original one that i first removed which was the factory one had a  w stamped on the metal support bracket which i had not notice because it was covered partially in lint which covered up that important piece of information and lead to my discovery that this valve is not of the correct wattage for my icemaker installed in my fridge so buyer beware check this info if you can find it on amazon or ask the seller to verify it before you purchase a water valve for your icemaker on amazon to make sure it will work with your icemaker and avoid what i have went through on this purchase,supco  single coil outlet water valve replaces whirlpool     ,12.74,0.5191256830601093,183.0,10.166666666666666,-97.36,183,1,24,18,1,17,1,3,23,183.0,183.0,10.1667,18.0,24.0,18.0,0.9444,17.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.1667,23.0,1.2778,62,22,54,22,104,35,84,35,0.81,0.42,0.35,0.17,0.67,0.58,62,32,36.3,37.1,0.6,0.74,4.3,6.08,0.89,18.11,0.64,0.75,13.5,2.6,0.21,0.6,0.1,0.02,0.12

B000G37E0A,5.0,my  son plays the sax  like many kids im sure he doesnt provide adequate time to really wet the reed instead of putting it into his mouth to get wet while he puts the sax together and gets himself situated he waits until hes ready for the reed basically gives it a small lick and goes about assembling the mouthpiece  when i saw this reed case i knew it was the answer i had been looking for  the case protects    the reeds from getting chipped in the case    keeps the reeds almost wet enough to play    but does not keep them so wet that they mildewit has been an excellent product  the only thing is that neither the box nor the humidifying insert that goes in advises you when you should replace the humidifying insert it would be great to have an actual indicator on the case itself to let me know when the insert needs to be replaced other than that i have no complaintsi am a longtime member of amazon and myself rely heavily on reviews provided by others when making a decision as to whether or not to purchase an itemwhether that purchase be one that i am making through amazon or another source such as a local store therefore i am very aware of the value of user feedback and do my best to assist others in making a quality decision by providing quality feedbackwas this review helpful to you if so i would very much appreciate it if you would rate this review accordingly many thanks,rico reed vitalizer humidity control  single refill pack  humidity,5.43,0.5977011494252874,,,-176.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,94,30,83,27,149,43,125,40,0.84,0.32,0.32,0.21,1.88,0.97,94,39,39.7,35.8,0.63,0.76,5.45,7.7,0.91,23.61,0.66,0.63,16.95,2.91,0.22,0.65,0.16,0.02,0.18
B00287YBAS,4.0,at first appearance this thing looks cheap and flimsy and its light as a feather too so i had my doubts removing it from the box that it would do the job  it comes completely compressed so the first thing i needed to do was to stretch it out and shape it into an s exactly like the picture shows for my install  best advice here is to go very slowly dont just yank it and try to get it to stretch open uniformly rather than just in the middle or at one end  the bending part is the trickiest and here again best to work it very slowly  i found it helped putting one hand inside the tube for support while bending to keep the material from kinking too much  if you get a kink you can gently push it out a bit just dont be too aggressive or you could easily put a crack in the tube  making the end connections is easy i put  slits on the collars at each end so theyd slip over the mating vents and used worm gear clamps to hold it in place  i also used a very tiny bit of aluminum tape just to seal the small gap where i had cut the  slits a bit too long on one side some people like to put tape all the way around the connection however thats not a good idea as it makes it harder to do your annual or biannual lint inspections  finally cranked up the dryer to make sure there were no leaks and there werent so the flimsy looking product ended up making a very solid install and at a great price,deflecto aluminum duct with connectors semi ridgid flexible   x  silver ,6.1,0.5759717314487632,,,-190.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,116,35,102,34,170,41,140,39,0.82,0.28,0.3,0.19,1.52,0.87,116,43,44.1,41.3,0.68,0.86,6.29,8.9,0.93,29.97,0.73,0.71,21.43,3.27,0.21,0.79,0.15,0.06,0.21
