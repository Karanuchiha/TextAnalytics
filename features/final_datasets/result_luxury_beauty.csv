B008RW1XEU,5.0,i dont often ding a product for its price after all prices here are in a constant state of flux and everyone has a different definition of what is expensive or too much money for me to righteously make a judgement call  so i wont bring down my rating of this brush because of its current priceit may be different tomorrowi wont even ding this brush for its claims to microexfoliate  whos to say  im no expert but i do know that using a gentle rotating brush on a motorized handle is just fine and very helpful  whats to say that a makeup brush cant do some minimal exfoliating too  so if this company wants to give this brush some hardtodefineandanalyze capabilities i say go right ahead  i wont debate it with you  which does not mean that i buy into the hoopla but that it is not what i am concerned about in a makeup brushwhat i will say is this  this brushs bristles and the thickness of the bristles and the trim work on the bristles is superior in quality and workmanship  it is a beautiful matte black brush with good balance and a bulge in a perfect place for my thumb and two fingers to grab hold  and this brush reminds me of the size shape and thickness of my koreanstyle brush set  and i love that set for its thick bristles thick handle and short stature  this is a better quality thoughby a long shotthis brush is very easy to hold and not fatiguing  its short handle makes it easy to be very exact with my application  and the thick concentration of very fine and soft bristles grab hold of foundation blush and concealers  but when i apply it to my face the bristles release their contents smoothly and evenlyi could not ask for more from a brush and i think that a quality brush like this will last a long time with proper tlc and proper cleaningwhat i hoped for but was disappointed to find missing  instructions for proper use and cleaning procedures and more info on the ambiguous claims  it would have been nice to learn how to achieve the results that this scottvincent borba line promises  but i can wing it well enough because its a really great brush,scottvincent borba antifatigue foundationcontour brush and line smoothing microexfoliation tool,38.0,0.5103626943005182,,,-303.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,144,54,135,54,228,77,200,77,0.88,0.39,0.38,0.24,2.94,1.21,144,41,41.0,38.7,0.63,0.76,6.74,9.54,0.92,27.86,0.68,0.76,27.94,3.74,0.18,0.67,0.17,0.04,0.21

B0002RI2PG,4.0,i tried the dermablend foundation with the dermablend powder combination several years ago but it always left my face looking caky and dry  then i discovered the maybelline mousse foundation and i switched but ive continued using the dermablend powder on top of my foundation it works fairly well for helping my makeup stay put all day and also for keeping the shine at bay i pat a generous amount of powder on top of my foundation with the puff provided let it settle for a few minutes and then use a large makeup brush to dust all the loose stuff off i prefer the translucent powder to the tinted because it helps even out my skin tone really well it doesnt clog my pores or cause any breakoutsthe issue i have with any powder is that it tends to make my face look well powdery it also makes any fine facial hair stand out  probably most gals over age  can relate to this so what i do after i dust off the powder is to use a hydrating spray i like teddie organics rose water but dont spray your face directly just spray into the air and walk under it letting the fine mist settle on your face youll be amazed at how smooth and creamy your face will look,dermablend loose setting powder,27.0,0.5927601809954751,,,-127.47,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,94,35,87,35,137,49,125,49,0.91,0.39,0.37,0.16,0.95,0.69,94,39,41.2,42.4,0.69,0.84,5.68,8.03,0.92,27.91,0.7,0.76,22.13,3.33,0.23,0.61,0.12,0.06,0.18

B00YPQCIJQ,5.0,this is a great product i bought it because no matter how many times i go out in the sun my tan has plateaued i have very pale skin even after going to the beach constantly and being out in the sun everyday even when i think that i am finally tan someone will ask me dont you ever go out in the sunthis tanner works amazingly i love the convenience of putting it on in the shower there is no mess whatsoever not even any staining on my rug or towels i turn the shower off step out on to my rug and apply it all over my body its easier to look in the mirror and apply it rather than doing it blindly in the shower it is easy to apply all over the body leaves no streaks and dries pretty quickly i was worried that combined with the water it would drip down my body and onto my rug but i havent had that problem at all i listen to one song on my iphone and by the time the song is over its time to rinse it off the first time i used it i didnt see a difference but after the second time i had a nice color by the next morning i accidentally left in on for about  minutes instead of  i dont know if that affected my end result i cant wait to see how the color develops over timethe smell isnt great it doesnt have a typical selftanner smell atleast the ones im used to but it smells kind of grandmaesque self tanners just dont smell nice however after you rinse it off and dry the smell isnt strong on skin its easily covered with some perfume it seems to have some cat attracting smell in it as well because every time i get out of the shower my siamese kittens come chasing after me trying to eat it maybe its just me i feel like i will run out of this very quickly i end up using  decent sized palmfulls of it for my entire body but the price compared to other self tanners is great i will definitely buy this again i may order the medium one next time instead because the light color is a very subtle change i would definitely recommend trying this its  times better than any ordinary self tanner,st tropez gradual tan in shower lotion light,18.56,0.47890818858560796,,,-312.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,137,46,123,45,239,64,205,61,0.86,0.3,0.34,0.16,1.4,0.84,137,35,40.0,40.3,0.57,0.77,6.27,8.86,0.9,23.41,0.6,0.78,34.91,4.18,0.22,0.55,0.12,0.07,0.19

B0013U0EYI,3.0,i ordered my first can of toppick hair building fibers based on the mostly good reviews by other users  i agree that this is a good product  its not great it doesnt make me suddenly look like i have lots of hair but i must say that it is better than the hair i naturally have now  apparently due to aging my once very thick hair has thinned drasically in the past ten years and i have tried many many products in an effort to either regrow hair or to give the illusion of more hair  toppick is applied after shampooing drying and styling and on top of any other hair thickening products  it is a fine powder that is manually shaken from the can toppick is sold in several different color shades and light brown is the first shade that i tried as i have light brown hair with blond highlights neither of which are my natural shade  after the first few shakes i discovered that there were more hair building fibers all over my shoulders shirt and the bathroom than on my head  i invested in the applicator made to fit over the top of the can and i urge anyone who is interested in trying toppick to do the same  the nozzletip applicator makes it much easier and neater to apply this product  the major plusses of toppick are that it hides my shiny pink scalp and i find that the fibers do give the illusion of more hair  the minuses include    i need to use a lot of toppick to achieve the desired results making this product more expensive than i thought it would be   i need to use a special spray to get the fibers to stick in place adding another expense   any time i comb or fix my hair during the day the toppick fibers come out so i need to reapply which is not easily accomplished when not at home and   the powder texture dulls the look of my hair  since the minuses are greater than the plusses for me i gave the toppick hair building fibers light brown only  stars  will i continue to use this product  absolutely  i havent found anything else that hides my naked scalp and gives even a slight illusion of more hair as well as as the toppick fibers  will i continue to use rogaine as well as other thickening and volume building products  absolutely  at least until a magic potion is developed to successfully regrow hair or my vanity weakens  if you are a mature woman and your crowning glory has been reduced to just a few strands i would highly recommend that you give toppick a try just dont make your expecttions too high,toppik hair building fibers,24.95,0.47276688453159044,,,-377.5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,152,53,141,51,290,80,253,78,0.87,0.31,0.35,0.16,1.97,0.99,152,39,39.3,39.2,0.52,0.76,6.31,8.93,0.89,21.61,0.56,0.63,28.99,3.81,0.18,0.52,0.15,0.05,0.2

B0042KWIBI,5.0,i had some awapuhi styling oil which i bought to control frizzies  mostly i loved the scent  hard to describe and fragrance preferences are very personal  so i tried the sea salt spray after reading reviewsif you like the tousled look for short hair this product is nothing short of miraculous  you spray a light mist over your hair  dash your fingers around  and youre done once you pull yourself up off the floor from surprise  its instantly so cool looking and i know nothing about styling my hairnow to temper this review ill tell you that ive since bought some indie sea salt spray the top rated sss on ultas site  indie is waterier and gives far less definition  it leaves your hair kinda drippy  great for taming frizzies  not as great for the beach tousled locksfor me i only slightly prefer the awapuhi sss scent to the indies scent  mitchell couldnt replicate the same awesomeness of the wild ginger quite as well with sss as with his styling oil  but the coconut scent of the indie smells like a salonproduct version of coconut scent  so its a bit of a toss up  but the difference in how easy styling is with awapuhi is remarkablein short best styling product ive ever tried  hands down  its pricier per oz but way worth it,awapuhi wild ginger texturizing sea spray,21.0,0.6098654708520179,,,-137.96,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,101,42,90,40,143,61,127,59,0.89,0.46,0.42,0.3,3.03,1.23,101,43,43.5,42.9,0.71,0.87,5.97,8.45,0.93,30.76,0.71,0.82,22.09,3.32,0.21,0.7,0.19,0.06,0.24

B00JL6TKRI,3.0,maybe its because i dont wear makeup everyday or maybe its because im just not that makeup savvy but this eye pencil almost disappointed me i thought it would be something worthwhile for having  say for special events ie english country dancing balls cotillion style and weddings or maybe a nice dinner etcwell again i dont use makeup much but i do know a thing or two however and this could simply be due to the brand but i thought the colour would be a bit darker than it appears on my skin granted i have fair skin but my skin is not blinding white and if anything my face is darker than seemingly most of my skin my face is what shows the most of my more olive tone i understood that it wouldnt come out dark like a black pencil would but this cacao colour almost looks like dirt on my skini found it very awkward to use the first time or two  and that could be to the infrequency to which i use makeupand that i dont usually apply it on me because others seem to either be willing or enjoy putting it on me  but there were a couple of things that i wasnt expecting while using it  first point of interest the point of the pencil while it came sharpened and ready to use thankfullywasnt as if i had to start from scratch it seemed difficult to actually apply on my skin from what i distinctly remember i tried to make sure my entire face was thoroughly dry before applying but i remember it seemed as if i had to apply loads of the pencilnot sure what one would call itthe contents  point  when applying and applying and so on when it finally did show up it wasnt even likeas even as i tried to draw the line i wanted it wasnt an even like both in thickness and in shade  if that makes sense  point  for me for some reason whether i drew with the tip or with a slight tiltangle it didnt always draw that thickness of line and would always seem to thicken or thin opposite of that which i wantedgranted those arent loads of points of issueconcern but that is what ive experienced thus far in my use of the pencil while i planned to use it for special occasions i started to use it for several days just as an everyday use and using it moregetting the feel of this particular pennothing seemed to improve for me the time it took me to apply it went down and i didnt have to use as many qtips to clean up and to help even out the uneven line that appears when i try to draw it  see points above i honestly just have to give up since i cant seem to figure out how to hold the pencil to get an even line and to get an even line the thickness that i wanti think that sums up my experience and the like with the pencil itselfthe colour since it isnt as dark as i thought it would be and more so because it almost looks like dirt on my face im not too impressed and wouldnt recommend this for someone who has skin like mine with a olivetint to any degree in it if it were a shade or two darker it might look better but to me from my perspective it just makes my eyes look tired almostwaterproof hmmmmnot sure how this company defines waterproof for i was able to use qtips rather easily to remove the smudges or uneven line with a hint of saliva made of water and as it turned out a time or two i ended up tearing up andor crying and poof no more eyeliner i even tried taking it off at the end of the day and nothing came off i think too one day while it wasnt super hot or humid thus i did not sweat i applied some and by the end of the day it wasnt there as if my body either absorbed it or it justwore offanywho i didnt not like this product  ie i wouldnt give it a  rating but i wouldnt necessarily say that i personally like it giving it a  would i recommend it not necessarily i would caution the buyer and encourage the prospective purchaser to know what they are doing ie know their bodyfaceskin well enough and have some kind of experience in what colours and kinds of makeup they like and work well on their face before jumping into purchasing this particular productat least the cacao colour now i myself didnt just jump into buying it as some of you more experienced makeup users might think for i had read up on the product itself looked closely at the product description and picture and thought about ifhowwhen i wouldcould use it etc and then decided to go for it to give it a try but like most things in life one doesnt always get the result they anticipated even after research and considerationsoif you like the cacao colour and are fairly set on purchasing this product  after looking into how it is described by the companyand maybe reading others storiesexperiences  then go for it i simply wouldntdont feel like i have anything to rave about or think that this is something super spectacular especially since the whole

B00Q7BBDXY,4.0,at the outset i suggest looking at the numerous videos on youtube or at fhis website search for fhi stylus or fhibrands dot com for pointers on how to use this styling brush  this styling brush does a lot of things well and some things not quite as well  if you are looking for big waves and flattening or controlling small sections of hair this tool is great  if you are looking for a straightener for lots of hair or a curling iron to make tight curls other tools will probably work better  however if you are looking for a single tool that will do just about everything except for small tight curls this tool is the one to getfor big waves and big curls this device is great  the brush is light and the temperature settings are easy to use  the settings are approximate for each type of hair  the easiest way to figure out the temperature to use is to start with a setting lower than you think you need and see how well that temperature works  overheating hair is generally not a good idea and can damage hair so easing into a temperature setting from the low side is better than going past the optimal temperaturethe brush heats up quickly  most of the ceramic areas heater areas have bristles to minimize the chance of burning hands and fingers but the edges of the brush can get warm  i am always careful around heated styling tools though the hottest areas on this brush are difficult to reachuse the brush on a section of hair at a time  the size of the section matters and changes the ultimate effect  experiment with different size sections and different curling techniques wrapping the hair clockwise or counterclockwise wrapping hair around the brush completely vs a sweeping brush stroke etc to see how your hair reacts  also consider using a spray to help hold the curls  you can use this styling brush as a straightener but a dedicated straightener might be simpler to use though the temperature control on this brush is better than many and probably most straightenersthis styling brush has lots of other features including a noslip handle and textured edge areas to help slide through hair  the brush powers off automatically after an hour for safety  the brush comes with a thermal bag to permit transporting an iron shortly after use so you can throw this brush in a suitcase without waiting for it to cool completelyas a single allpurpose styling tool this particular tool does most things well and easily replaces up to three different tools  the tool is light weight and easy to handle  the tool looks good too  though it would be unusual to impress friends with a styling tool it might be possible with this oneenjoy,fhi heat stylus thermal styling brush,39.95,0.4574468085106383,,,-388.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,161,58,146,57,288,83,249,82,0.86,0.33,0.36,0.28,5.23,1.62,161,41,40.5,40.0,0.56,0.78,6.71,9.49,0.9,23.95,0.59,0.72,36.23,4.26,0.2,0.51,0.13,0.03,0.16

B018GZYGFU,5.0,the loreal dermablend professional line of cosmetics is new to me  they earn being in a higherend category in my opinion they do not seem to be scented or too chemical the jars tubes compacts are made very sturdy to last along with your makeups i have many favorites among them yet i believe they all stand very well on their own some two or more of these creamy products come with an application spatula and this appears to be an optional extra  also there is a little instruction leaflet included with every producti hope it is going to be efficient way to review all of the ones product in this line including compatible products along the way respectively loreal dermablend professional cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen  loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder no spf loreal dermablend professional set  refresh longlasting makeup setting spray no spf loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation  spf loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo no spf loreal dermablend professional quickfix body no spf loreal dermablend professional leg and body makeup  loreal dermablend quickfix concealer stick spf i have been using loreal products since the  when my best friend was wearing a frosted lipstick i liked and i later sought out  it smelled good too it was a truer color in my eyes since many comparable brands were putting red tinges into the light pinks and such  also some of the loreal colors of lipsticks and eyeshadows were pearly and i liked them because they looked very ethereal as with the pinkviolet lipstick that changed colors depending on the lighti have aged and my last purchase was a loreal infallible product one of many in a line which rarely or never need reapplication for my creased lids and bitten lips i have been so obsessed that i have a whole zipper case full of the eyeshadows alone i have a lot of products from their visible lift line for my skin texture i especially enjoyed the blur ones  now i am going to move on to have more choices in my zip bagthere has been more exposure with loreal in my experience than i can mention here including most recently a lovely reddishbrown shade of eyeshadow that stays put a supermascara another lip paint some facetone enhancers and a creamytodry lightcolored eye light among othersi am happy to see more highend products from loreal that should work well for young and old alike especially since it seemed to me years ago that their products were for my younger crowd   dermablend cover crme with titanium dioxide sunscreen this is the first item in this line of dermablend cosmetics from loreal that ive received and it is my very favorite  it covers my skin imperfections wellmy first attempt with it doesnt count since i spread it very thin allowing a bit of dermatitis i had at the time to show some dry skin through  and i went out that night wondering why this was happening  i hadnt read the instructions yet  first of all i thought i needed to get rid of the rash that was there before reapplying and reviewing this product and second i thought i needed to exfoliate since i have dry patches on spots  now i get it  this particular crme has to be built up gradually for me and building it up judiciously is not problematic at all  this product is soft and smooth  it appeared to be a very thin product at first and it kind of softens and blends as you work with it  it is lovelyif i use a sponge applicator it will ruin one purpose of it for me which is to cover varying imperfections and when i apply it with smoothing dabs it appears blended and i really find out how radiant and thorough a cover cream makeup can be  it has alone a bit of chroma to it as does dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation  spf  in my opinion unlike many other cover products i have used alone they gleam in the light more than my other cover makeups without chalkiness  very nicethe other purpose for me is that it has a  spf sunscreen  all other cosmetics with sunscreen i have tried have  spf or lower and not my needed  spf that my dermatologist recommends  she has said that even in my home with shades closed i am exposing my skin to potential damage  i score   here for this as well as the other qualities of this linethe two colors i have are both medium ones one a bit lighter and both appropriate for me especially my indulgence of mixing other lighter or darker colored loreal dermablend pro products with themive been feeling a bit like a chemist with the many loreal dermablend pro products listed here and i realize you may not have this type of a menu but i am hoping this info will help somehow to see the flexibility here if not anything else loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder no spfneeded the wonderful crmes i love work nicely with loreal dermablend professional translucent loose setting powder with micronized powder with the cotton puffs it hides flaws when that is part of what you are going for  this particular product is very fine not grainy and perhaps a bit creamy  it definitely blends in well  it is very nice for creating a thin and matte next barrier keeping the crme bases foundations from smudging to hands clothing  in various ways since amazon is not going to know my exact skin color i have experimented i am able to get some creative looks i sought in using the various loose powder shades together dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder in my three separate medium shades separate jars when applied and then dusted off created light on dark or dark on light look as i so chosea what i mean is that with the lighter shade of crme i was able to get the same look with the darker powder as with the opposite of that technique using the darker crme and a lighter powder altogether with these medium shades i was able to get a perfect match thus prolonging my experienceb also with the white translucent powder i have found that i am getting a more dimensional look by applying the light shade powder on certain areas of my face and on top or around in certain areas like cheeks nose chin forehead i will carefully apply and moments later lightly dust the mediumtoned translucent powders as described allowing it to not look quite so much like monotone matte over my sallow complexion  another plus  for mei have found recently that i need to put on fine dustings of all powders for myself personally and not necessarily all over my face and necku have been using a bit of bright cream blush oddly enough though you may find it unnecessary you can still have a dimensional looki like to play with the powders yet when i am in a rush i will make errors not being subtle and not dusting before other products  also i am  and my baggy undereye application errors are the most noticeable i get rid of this bagginess first  i will use the powders now especially with other lighter dermablend crme applications or with the highquality dermablend pro smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation  spf listed below and as well as their other foundations all definitely for photos where a shine or two really countsone thing that helps give a nice touch over the powders and such is the loreal dermablend professional set  refresh longlasting makeup setting spray the powders are probably quite wonderful for an oily skin type for example they are nice for a youthful complexion and i believe they are going to look quite radiant on a woman with lessnoticeable pores and without wrinkle issues along with age and skin texture combined  in my case i am fine and safest when i am wellrested loreal dermablend professional set  refresh longlasting makeup setting spray no spfthese dermablend base products are synergistically enhanced with a nice sheen of fresh with a spray application of loreal dermablend professional set  refresh longlasting makeup setting spray just lightly mist your face with your hair pulled back to enhance your look and seal your makeup applications  the mist isnt as fine as i had expected but it works for me  even with dusted powders it will make a difference  it is that simple for me loreal dermablend professional smooth liquid camo medium cover foundation  spfthis a product that i had underestimated until today when i applied it under dermablend pro translucent loose setting powder which may not be necessary if you want that chroma look yet because i preferred the varying builtup applications i achieved with the dermablend professional crme i missed something with trying this last  as before i was too quick to judge  i had applied it very thick and then i went out  i thought to myself that is was masklike yet nice moist covernot only can i spot apply this creamierliquidy product to cover the face and problem areas with my fingers i can also use a sponge blender for a more airbrushed look then applying more product wherever as needed i also can add a finishing touch of the dermablend professional set  refresh longlasting makeup setting spray for a fresh stay with or without powders winwinwin loreal dermablend professional intense powdercamo no spfthis is a lovely and creamy intense powder in a nice mirrored compact with a sponge applicator in separate compartments  while this color is quite dark for me one quality besides the products ability to render a fine cover layer if desired is that i do not see wrinkles really  maybe the thin layer or the creaminess  and the staying power especially with the fresh mist of loreal dermablend professional set  refresh longlasting makeup setting spray  also i can dab and smooth this powder wherever i want to whatever area of the face or neck  the darker color applied gently is making a nice bronzer if applied thin  i do know that is stretching it though i havent tried it over the above loreal dermablend professional liquid camo product since this is a very dark color however i suppose this might possibly work though this does go on thin and i do not think a crme or foundation is needed to get a good look very nice camo cover product loreal dermablend professional quickfix body no spfwow again  i hadnt understood at first how i can use this as one of the colors i own is a darker bronze and while i hadnt yet noticed the medium my shade  i mistakenly applied some of the dark under my cheekbones to see a defined look which actually worked for me yet thick as i applied it  and silly me i am thinking that since this product says body in the title it is going to be nice for use on varicose veins and other body imperfections like a permanent rash i have double win with this product resultsthis is a creamy rollup stick cover product which does the job without rubbing off too much i love the idea of having a smooth bodyskin look as with the generous tube of the wonderful and longlasting dermablend professional leg and body makeup however im mentioning this quick fix product first as im partial to a more natural yet youthful look only working with the blemishes and letting the natural skins still show through  this is my personal preference  it isnt quite going to be looking as flawlessly airbrushed overall as with the full body makeup yet it is the product i will use first especially during the day i love it loreal dermablend professional leg and body makeup it is so nice to wear tights stockings or nylons during the winter to have confidence that leg imperfections will not be seen with dresses and on ankles under pants above boots  however during cooler months especially it is very nice to see perfect body skin peeking out of your clothing  not only does this product render a flawless airbrushed look it is actually very resistant to liquid or rubbing off onto hands or clothing  i absolutely loved the look when i put it on and then darn i was noticing in the light that my shade was a bit peachier than my actual sallow skin  this might not be problematic for you with fullbody applications as for me on an occasional basis as desired yet finding your closest match will save you a lot of bother and will please you i believe  as i have expressed that this product renders a nice airbrushed look and i believe even because of the staying power alone this dermablend pro product is worth looking into  it just didnt muss up and rub off loreal dermablend quickfix concealer stick spf this works fabulously it is creamy and it stays put it is smart just as the loreal dermablend professional cover crme because it has that strength of sunscreen that my dermatologist recommends even as i am in my home shades drawn as my dermatologist has warned about  i have already sun damage under my right eye where there is a dark spot  this covers very well looks flawless with or without other products yet it works synergistically with the wonderful loreal dermablend pro line i have it in a tan color and i would have thought since i usually use lighter shades of concealers that it would not have looked so perfect with my medium skin lovely plus  and very smartvery nice products indeed  enjoy,dermablend makeup

B00HR1JRTU,3.0,i can see where people think this is an eye treatment and i guess it is a bit this is way more of a concealer its pigmented and has some pearlized material to deflect light and get rid of the appearance of dark circles although la rocheposay as a company has the reputation for a strong science component to their products they are also a cosmetic company and thats pretty much what this product is  a cosmeticit does contain caffeine which has a diuretic effect to relieve puffiness it also boasts something called pheresorcinol which i guess is their own proprietary compound resorcinol itself is an ingredient in argan oil the company states that its own blend is known for its targeted action on melanin making it sound like this is some kind of skin whitener  all products that claim brightening qualities are really talking about lighteningpuffiness can cast a shadow which can cause the appearance of dark circles this particular product has a metal applicator i gather the point of that in using it to spread the concealer around is that the cold metal will make the puffiness go away you can get the same effect by putting a metal teaspoon in the fridge or in a glass of ice water then using the back of the spoon to press down the puffiness also watch salt intake which causes water retention and adds to the puffinessyou might think caffeine would work on dark circles but that would depend upon the cause of the circles some are hereditary others can be lifestyle related tiredness or can come from age if your circles have a brownish tinge use an apricot colored pigment to counter it this can be in a concealer or just put on the skin then use a concealer if your circles have a blue cast try a yellowish concealerthis particular product is fine as a concealer but make no mistake this is much less of a treatment than it is a cosmetic to hide not cure dark circles short of surgery and injections nothing permanently gets rid of dark circles but a good concealer and knowing how to use it isnt a bad second choice,la rocheposay pigmentclar dark circles eye cream  fl oz,42.99,0.5177111716621253,,,-284.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,139,56,134,56,219,68,190,68,0.87,0.36,0.4,0.24,2.94,1.21,139,41,41.5,43.4,0.63,0.84,6.64,9.39,0.92,27.75,0.71,0.78,29.47,3.84,0.2,0.67,0.14,0.04,0.18

B00VXASC9M,5.0,this mask is excellent  its a great treatment for my dry color treated highlighted hair  i also heat style regularly so dryness is always an issue  its the perfect remedy for my chemically abused dry tresses  i shampoo with a sulfate free formula and then apply a generous amount of this mask making sure my hair is totally saturated especially the midlengths and ends  i then use a heat cap for about  minutes which helps the mask soak into the cuticle as it is opened by the heat  ive also used this mask overnight with good results  because this mask is quite heavy i then rinse for a full five minutes  i apply my regular serum and styling products and let my hair air dry overnight  in the morning i use a curling iron to create loose waves  truthfully after using this mask my hair looks awesome  the ends are smooth and sleek and theres no trace of the crunchy dryness i had prior to using this mask  it truly hydrates incredibly well  in fact i dont think ive ever used a mask that was quite as good as this one  my hair has body and shine and it responds really well to my styling efforts  this mask smells divine and is thick and rich so a little goes a long way so this jar will last a long time even though the recommended usage is once a week  if you dont have a heat cap you can cover your hair with a plastic shower cap and use a hair dryer for about  minutes on low to generate steam which will open the cuticle so the mask can penetrate the hair shaft  you can also use a hot towel microwave a damp towel for  minutes and then carefully wrap it around your hair  when the towel cools repeat this procedure  these two methods work just as well as a heat cap  however this mask works equally well when used overnight just be sure you cover your pillow with a towel  the macadamia oil in this formula obviously has a healing effect which makes it great for dry damaged locks  as long as you rinse well i think this mask would also be suitable for fine hair  all in all i like everything about this mask  it makes my hair look incredible and the effects really last  im a loyal once a week user of this formula and i highly recommend it especially for those who have chemically treated hair  its a superb formula that works great for me and im sure it would work equally well for you,macadamia professional nourishing moisture masque,12.0,0.454337899543379,,,-356.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,148,61,135,59,273,91,237,89,0.87,0.38,0.41,0.23,2.77,1.18,148,41,41.1,40.8,0.54,0.82,6.33,8.96,0.89,22.32,0.57,0.65,22.23,3.33,0.14,0.6,0.14,0.07,0.21
