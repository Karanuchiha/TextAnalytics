B0017T7XCG,5.0,i snagged this deal from amazon when they were at  the week before christmas the harps arrived just before new years im fairly obsessed with special  these days having come around from marine bands and traveling through the gamut of harmonica brands and modelsa few things of note about this  these are indeed the new progressive special  not nos ones from before that change the case is pretty good although it is a bit cheap and made in china the outer clamshell is quite rigid although it is of a flexible canvas but you can tell that lower quality materials were used for the padding and cutouts probably cheap opencell foam for the one and styrofoam for the other its all lined with a velvetlike material on the inside however and the harps do fit snugly not a bad addon for this purchase but not really a main reason to buy this set fyi there is space for two additional harps in the case the harps are all gapped high for my taste but the two lower harps a and g are gapped very widely this is a nonissue if you know how to tweak your harps which i do the e and the c were the best two ootb but ymmv yes that e is in there and its a bit hard to know what to do with it two things however a at  even if you never play the e you are still getting a good deal for the four remaining harps b if you are handy half an hour with a file and tuner and youve got a high f still a fringe harp for me but probably more useful than the e perhaps more useful still break out the blutak or the soldering iron and you could take it down to an eb you could even experiment with an alternate tuning layout tuning this to easy third would let you play across the whole harp in  position as if it were  which is the key of a major could come in pretty handy for country tunes and the likesome observations about and thoughts on the new progressive special  designfirst impressions are that they are not significantly different than the old special  the tone is clear and certainly darker than a marine band on the bettergapped ones the bends come easy and can be sustained well with out squeals or unwanted overtones the lowerkeyed ones seem breathy to me but i am fairly certain thats due to the wide gaps and not due to being leakyout of curiosity ive just opened up the g harp and am comparing it to an older special  from my main set heres how they line up covers other than whats stamped on them the covers appear identical to the older version same profile same placement of the screw holes slightly forward of center and same coverplate screws slotted head with the little square nuts the last is a bit of disappointment as i was hoping that they would have upgraded the coverplate screws to at least those that are used on the mb deluxe reedplates the reedplates differ in that the new ones have two extra holes at each end apparently for mounting on a different comb the two additional holes seem to match the spacing of my mb deluxe otherwise the screw hole patterns and other cutouts are identical to the older model spec  reedplate screws this seems like a bit of a negative the new screws are thinner and have smaller heads this could be bad as the smaller heads would tend to put more focused pressure on the reedplate which could warp the plate a bit if they are tightened too far it also means that you wont be able to mix and match reedplates from the old spec  line with the new ones heres the screw measurements using calipersold reedplate screw dimensionsscrew head diameter screw shaft diameter screw length new reedplate screw dimensionsscrew head diameter screw shaft diameter screw length  reeds as i said most of the reeds were gapped too wide for my preferences ootb the low harps were gapped especially wide for example it looks like the  draw reed on my new g harp is gapped approximate  the thickness of the reed tip reed dimensions appear identical to the old spec  and tuning marks seem comparable to the way they were done before looks to me like they were tuned with a hand file and not a rotary tool or a drawscraper reed tips have crosshatched file marks and only one reed was filed at the base this was done diagonally and over a very narrow swath tuning a quick check with a tuner app on my phone suggests its tuned to  with the  blow dead on the money the  blow a little flat and the  blow a little sharp the rest is definitely tuned to a compromise of some kind for example  draw comes up  cents flat and  blow is  cents flat chords sound pretty smooth and single notes are generally in okay tuning seems similar to the way the special  has always been tuned comb externally the comb appears absolutely identical to the old spec  comb the only perceptible difference may be the color which seems slightly bluer on the new harps than the old but that could simply be a matter of age internally it appears that the comb has some extra holes at each end perhaps to accommodate other cover plates eg mb deluxecrossover these seem not to have any effect on airtightness or ergonomics howeveri spent about  minutes working on the g harp doing basic gapping and shaping of how the reeds lay that small work makes it play so much better than straight out of the box the tone is rich but clear the draw bends are all smooth and very present chords are nice and full and the tuning seems very accurate the  overblow was there and easy to get and sustain with minimal squeal although i could not bend it up probably some embossing would help that couldnt get the  or  overblow to sustain so those holes would need some work although i tend not to use those obs much blow bends were easy and sounded good couldnt get the  halfstep however which means i need to do some more adjustment on those reedsin general i think these will all be very good harps once gapped to my playing style the only reservation i have is the change to the reedplate screws which i think could be a significant issue if overtightened one should be very careful when reassembling these harps the screws should be barely tightened just so that they are not loose and one should be very careful not to overtorque them probably they should also be tightened slowly one at a time in a crosspattern like tightening the bolts on a care tire,hohner marine band special   pro pack  keys of g a c d amp

B001J1SX94,5.0,my instant order update notice shows that i purchased this in december   and during the time ive owned this cable it has been heavily used and is still noisefree and perfect in all respects  for context i purchased it to connect a mic tube preamp to a mixer so it has been set up and torn down many times in the past two and a half yearskey points that earn the five stars is the heavy duty strain reliefs which keep the inside conductors from bending and stressing i am guessing those are why this patch continues to be noise free and provide a strong signal  also the xlr connectors are of the highest quality in the past i have cut corners only to find that small details like connectors do not always mate well not so with these they engage and disengage without binding or looseness bear in mind that they have been in frequent use  inserted and removed hundreds of timesthe outer jacket is fairly thick which to me is an indication that the manufacturer did not cut corners when this cable was constructedoverall i am pleased because this patch has withstood a lot of use and has held up perfectly i would not hesitate to purchase more of this brand and model if i need additional ones,whirlwind  xlr female to xlr male microphone cable,7.49,0.6454545454545455,,,-134.91,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,101,37,93,36,140,40,110,39,0.79,0.35,0.37,0.29,2.61,1.14,101,43,42.9,42.3,0.72,0.85,6.04,8.54,0.93,32.48,0.85,0.87,23.52,3.43,0.25,0.81,0.19,0.05,0.25

B0006LOBA8,5.0,i regularly play acoustic and electric guitar and so my playing technique is very heavy handed which is somewhat necessary for playing an acoustic guitar if you really want good intonation and presence unfortunately electric guitars require more finesse and dexterity if you want to get the most of your vibrato or bends which is why  to  gauge string sets are the de facto preference for every playerback in the  and early  guitar strings didnt come in the lighter gauges that we have them today  and  sets were commonplace electric guitar strings were more or less lightergauged acoustic guitar strings this is how the beatles were able to get those thick clean tones and how stevie ray vaughan who also used  on his strat came to create his legendary tone as well heavier is better is just a myth though dozens of guitar heroes use standard gauge strings sometimes as light as  it really just depends on your playing style and the amount of physical response you want from your strings in this case heavier is better if you have a strong picking technique and hard attackthese days i have been playing a lot of heavy metal and i needed strings that wouldnt flap around when playing those tight galloping rhythms and alternate picking runs i decided to try out this baritone guitar set on my les paul and ive been really impressed with the thickness of the tone you dont necessarily need a stratscaled guitar or anything longer to rock these strings so long as you adjust your bridge accordinglyanother benefit of using  is that the gstring is wound which means more tension and less tuner slippage while playing every guitarist knows what im talking about when i say how frustrating it is when the gstring slides out of tune more so than any other string on this set the gstring is a wound  so literally twice the thickness of the high estring while this doesnt make it totally immune to tuning slippage itll get you really closethe last benefit of using  is that it is like resistance weight training in every respect after playing a couple months on  if you go back to  or  youll feel like you can fly across the fretboard with ease,daddario  nickel wound electric guitar strings highstrungnashville tuning ,2.99,0.5384615384615384,,,-294.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,145,68,133,65,236,97,196,94,0.83,0.48,0.47,0.27,3.77,1.37,145,38,40.8,40.0,0.61,0.79,6.67,9.44,0.91,26.62,0.68,0.71,26.33,3.63,0.19,0.67,0.18,0.05,0.23

B01BDMKH2Y,5.0,update   march i was contacted by the company and here is the result of that contact    they had misprinted their instruction manual  the kit actually performs exactly as it should  they are making corrections in the manual and the new manual should be included with new orders and available soon on the company website for download    this drum kit is a new product for the company and they do not have their website yet fully functional to be able to enter in the product for support  that is being addressed and should be correct shortly    the delay in their response to me was for them to pull a product manual and verify what i had told them in my email  they then went to correct the issues before they contacted me with what they had found how they were going to address the issues and to be able to walk me through the correct process    they are addressing the references on their website to include amazon  pointing to a physical reseller was a way to provide in person assistance for questions on technique of useas i had said in my initial review the drums sound fantastic they are easy to configure the engineering that went into the layout support cable management is superb  again while not as flexible as a yamaha  system it does not cost  either  i believe this is an excellent value for the money and will provide a lot of enjoymentbased on the companys response and the steps they are taking i would now recommend this productend of updateoriginal review unmodifiedi ordered this drum set because i had always wanted to get into drums but was not keen on the noise level it would entail for neighbors so had stuck to electronic pianos  when this set became available i jumped at the chance to try it  here is what i found    do not expect this set to have the same performance level as an  set from yamaha  that being said the sounds that this set is capable of producing is very good and you have a lot of room for making custom changes    this set assembles fairly quickly  it took me about an hour from start of opening box to sitting down to try it out  the instructions consist of a pictograph  use the picture on amazon on your computer it is a better picture to show you where everything goes  keep in mind that all of the mounts for drums and cymbals go to the outside of the ushaped frame you sit inside of  the wiring diagram does not really exist  instead what you are looking at is the name for each part of the set and its location  take the cable assembly and look at the tag on the end of each cable  match name on the tag with item in the picture and you have your wiring diagram    once you have everything where it belongs and have all of the cables connected use the velcro straps provided to bundle the cables along the rack  it makes for a very neat installation    the control module is powered by a very small transformer  the reach on the cable to that plug in transformer is about  feet  it is really very short so plan accordingly  you will either need an amplifier and speakers to plug into the unit or a set of headphones  i used a set of studio grade sony headphones and the sound is incredible  you have a separate volume control for headphones and for output  so you can adjust accordingly  if you want to use it in a house the headphones keep it very quiet  you will still hear the sticks hitting the devices but they are made of rubber and what you basically hear is dull clacks    now is where we start to get into issues  there are supposed to be  songs prerecorded that have separate volume controls for the drum set and for the song  this lets you listen and play along or to turn off the drum section and just play with the song  there is also a record feature and a start feature for the record  the problem is that only the first  work correctly  the next twenty have only the drum section and the rest do nothing but play a single note every time you press start    so i went to contact the company and get help  guess what  no contact phone number  they point you to user groups to solve your issue  nice except this product is so new there is no user group for it  ok you can then go to a commonly asked questions section  nice except there is no section for this product  ok last resort you can send email and they are supposed to respond  fine it has been  days and i still have not heard from them    one of the other things they try to do is to point you to a seller of their equipment for technical support since they are music stores selling musical equipment and they service that equipment  great except i got this from amazon  so while the sounds of the drums are very good and i am quite happy with the functional design the support from the company at this point is nonexistent and the equipment is not doing what they say it will do  now i have not tried to modify all of the drum sets so i have no idea if that functions correctly or not but if it has short comings like the prerecorded songs do  then you are up a creek without a paddle since support seems to be nonexistent  based on the fact that this appears to be a very new product and the fact that support is nonexistent at this point in time for the product i would not recommend buying this unless you are willing to fully check it out  yourself in the  days you have to return it with amazon and you do not mind if some of the features are missing  i will update this review if something changes,alesis forge kit  eightpiece electronic drum set with forge drum module and usb port for userloaded

B0010DKD26,4.0,worked fantastically well for a beginner cellist works perfectly to serve as the learning instrument for the inevitable lessons to be learned from playing the cello eg they love to fall overhowever you need to invest a wee bit more to get this up and running needs decent strings the ones it comes with are appalling and even the best cellist will only produce migraines with the provided strings or they break after about a month i used prelude which run about  online store markup for these is atrocious though id recommend buying two sets one to immediately put on the cello second for backups or you can try and use the provided ones as backups need to upgrade the bow the one provided is rather unbalanced and heavy makes for a beginner cellest to have extremely sore bowing hand i nabbed a carbon black bow for about  rosin is bleh it sounds like an elephants hoof rubbing up against rough wood in every bow i nabbed the jade lopera for upgrades run about  totalat this point it sounds great the other musicians compliment me on it too so not just biased  fantastic finish however its only superficial equivalent to vinyl flooring which is my only complaint  if you so much as lightly ding this cello if youre a beginner and limited to playing in a small space ie a bedroom the cello loves to grab onto things and fall over even with the resting kit provided youll see the cheap lightly colored wood underneath which shows up very very clearly against the dark finish id recommend using a dark sharpie  colored pencil  etc to try and obscure the revealed wood a high quality cello would be the same wood all the way though but for a beginner best to learn to respect the cello without busting the walletsecond complaint is that the tailpiece was not properly protected during shipping and slid around everywhere making quite visible scratches kind of hidable with wood polish but luckily was mostly under where the tailpiece is obscuring anywaysfinally the case is nothing more than a sleeve and only protects against scratches and dust even with the best care dings are inevitable for such a large instrument esp if you plan on regularly loading into a car trunk for cello practice also the place to put the bow is a long hole so it stresses the bows strings every time you slide it in and out vulgar reference but zoom in on the picture and youll see what i mean sometimes even pulling or warping bow hairs this is what lead me to seek an actual case which are relatively expensive considering the price of this kit but well worth it ill leave you to finding a case that fits your needs if the provided one does not mine though i nabbed off of ebay probably not a bad place to seek a cello case for a reasonable price,cecilio  student cello with soft case stand bow rosin bridge and extra set of strings size ,55.09,0.5313131313131313,,,-414.04,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,194,79,175,73,302,115,260,109,0.86,0.42,0.41,0.21,3.61,1.34,194,44,44.3,43.5,0.64,0.88,7.89,11.16,0.92,32.0,0.67,0.72,42.05,4.59,0.22,0.67,0.15,0.05,0.2

B00L98I702,1.0,this review is for the performance  model of the  classical guitar capo  this is the new streamlined version of the original performance model  i wanted to love this new improved model  i watched the video on youtube on how it worked how great it was and how it was so much lighter than the original  i have had the original performance  classical guitar capo for years and that works great  i dont have any problems moving that capo with one hand either but i did think it would be nice if it was a little lighter in weight  so i ordered the performance  and couldnt wait to try it when it arrived  i tried it and packaged it to return the same day  thank goodness for amazons great service and return policy the problem was the new model did not have the strength to hold down the strings on a classical guitar  it could barely fit around the neck  i struggled with it for a while in the case maybe there was some kind of a learning curve to this thing  but when applied every one of the six strings buzzed  if i could get a string to come out clear there was impact on the sound  the string quality was brighter than it would otherwise be  it was not a pleasant tone changed  in short the design change was just a disaster for the classical guitar  so this one goes back and i will hurry and order a second original performance classical guitar capo before they stop making them  sometimes perfect is good enough and for me that first design was perfect for what my guitar needed  this new design not so much, accordion accessory ,6.04,0.4823943661971831,,,-199.87,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,96,18,87,18,168,33,135,33,0.8,0.24,0.19,0.06,0.12,0.25,96,29,37.5,40.1,0.57,0.73,5.24,7.41,0.89,20.38,0.64,0.91,26.28,3.62,0.21,0.61,0.15,0.03,0.18

B0002ODPDI,5.0,i dont really have much to add to what other  and  star raters have said primarily i just wanted to contribute my star rating to add to the overall average and help counteract those who have inappropriately downrated this because of shipping or other issues not related to the instrumentreviewers seem kind of evenly split as to whether this instrument is loud or soft  some say that it is quiet enough to play while people are sleeping  my opinion is that it is loud  my cats hate it they run when they see me reach for it  they do not mind my accordion in fact they will sit right next to me while i play accordion but they head for the hills when either this or the bagpipe comes out  thus i am thinking that the volume of this is comparable to that of a bagpipe chantermy main issue with this has just been intonation  when i play it in what seems to me to be the most natural way it is basically a full half step flat from what it is supposed to be  ie the bottom note c sounds like b instead  i can bend it up to somewhere around a c using mouth and air pressure but it makes it harder for me to play and the note isnt very stable then because it doesnt seem like the note that the instrument really wants to play but rather is being forced to play  i have had my pocket sax for nearly a month now and play it some almost every day and still i continue to have this issue after this time  another minor complaint that i have is just the sound of the b note  this is obtained using a cross fingering fingering a c and then lowering it by leaving a hole open and closing the one below that  to me this sounds like it just bends the c note down a hair and not like it is its own separate true note  i like to hear a clear break in the sound when going from one note to another  on any other nonaccidental note throughout the fundamental register you can hear thiseven if its just a half step  when you open or close a hole crisply and cleanly there is a disruption in the wave generated as it suddenly changes wavelength and you can actually hear that little crack in the sound  this does not happen between the b and c it doesnt sound like you are playing two distinct notes but rather just varying the pitch of one note a little bit  this is likely true on other crossfingered accidentals as well though i have not advanced to the point where i am playing things that need accidentals outside of the natural scale of the instrument other than b so i cant attest to that for sure  i call b an accidental because of the crossfingering whereas the note that comes naturally by lifting fingers in succession is b flat  for this reason the instrument although nominally in c actually plays more easily and naturally in keys of f natural d minor and dorian g minor  these keys also have an advantage over playing in c because you can go below the tonic whereas in c thats the bottom note of the instrument which for many or most melodiesbeyond mary had a little lambjust isnt adequateas other reviewers have noted this instrument is unlike any other and you will have to devote time and effort into playing it decently  the embouchure is different from other reed instruments my professional clarinetist friend couldnt make a sound when he first put it to his mouth and the fingering is different from other woodwinds  other reviewers seemed to find the fingering system to be flawed and marked it down because of that but i dont see where this should be an issue  all instruments have their own fingering this would be like downrating a mandolin because it is fingered differently from a guitar  there are people who play both instruments well you just learn and use the fingering of each different instrument as it is  i play irish whistle with six fingers and diatonic note spacing and i play bulgarian kaval with eight fingers and quasichromatic note spacing and its not a problem  i can play many tunes on either instrument and knowing how to finger it on one doesnt interfere in any way with playing it on the other  i dont even think about it my fingers know what to do when they feel what instrument they are lying on  now i have yet another fingering system to become familiar with im not concerned in the least,xaphoon xaph maui pocket saxophone black,85.3,0.4090909090909091,,,-715.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,227,78,206,74,450,98,374,94,0.83,0.25,0.34,0.12,1.38,0.83,227,40,39.2,38.3,0.5,0.77,7.57,10.7,0.89,23.69,0.55,0.62,39.38,4.44,0.17,0.56,0.15,0.05,0.2

B000KIPT26,4.0,i have mixed feelings about this product but the bottom line is that i feel it is a good valuesome reviews mention build quality i would say the build quality is very good the only cheap looking part is the knob as mentioned in another review which for some reason is not completely round other than that it looks like a solid wellbuilt unitfor some reason behringer has gone out of its way to make this product confusing the most confusing thing about it is that out of the box all of the filters are set to peq which means there are no single shot or automatic filters available at all this might be the reason why some reviewers here and elsewhere have complained that the unit does not stop feedback because it wont so the very first thing you need to do it press and hold peq turn the knob so the display shows  and then press peq again now you can press learn or press and hold it and it will search and destroy feedback as advertisedi also discovered a hidden feature which is that an automatic filter can be turned into a single shot one but first again behringer chooses terminology that makes a simple concept hard to grasp assuming you have set the number of peq filters to zero you start out with  filters assuming you are in stereo mode left for the unit to use to deal with feedback if a filter is set while learn is pressed this increases the single shot s count so lets say that by either pressing and holding learn or just clicking it and allowing feedback to occur by normal means you end up with four slots set you now press learn again so its led is off and run shows if feedback occurs and another filter is deployed it is the same kind of filter that was learned the only difference is a if it will be remembered if you turn the unit off and then on again or b if you briefly press reset got that the only difference between single shot and automatic is how they are resetso lets say  you have four single shot filters and in run mode two more automatic filters get deployed if you press learn turn the knob to six up from four and press learn again guess what you now have six single shot filters because all you had to do is increment the single shot count this is very useful to knowthe other oddity is that at first i thought my unit was doa even after talking to customer support they suggested i return the unit because i was getting no input signal at all no motion in the led input lights even though when i connected my mixer output directly to my amplifier everything was fine well ends up that the jacks i was using are shrink wrapped and that was enough to prevent the jack from making a connection even though those cables work perfectly well on everything else i have ever used forever so an oddity in the jacks of this unit as wellthe other unexpected feature of this unit is that it significantly attenuates the signal by this i mean if you connect a mixer output to the unit and then run the output to an amplifier the signal is significantly weaker this isnt too big of a deal just turn up the amp but why it has to be isnt exactly clearanother thing about the unit is the rude way it overloads yes it is digital but a  plus is also digital and when it overloads it is nowhere near as run it terms of the amount of breakup is causes combine this with the automatic learning feature and you get breakup that is murder on the speakers at a bare minimum in automatic learning mode the signal ought to be automatically muted just before it overloadsother than that the unit performed for me quite well i basically hooked it up between my mixer and amplifier and turned everything on except the amplifier i then played normally and turned up the output of the mixer until the input leds of the unit were hot but did not clip then i turned the amplifier on with the volume all the way down i initially didnt use automatic learning and so i pressed learn once and gradually raised the volume of the amp while snapping my fingers into the mic which created feedback the unit most of the time deployed a filter before the unit clipped once it was done sometimes it would deploy more than one filter i raised the volume of the amplifier and repeated the finger snapping process i repeated this process until the volume was significantly higher than i wanted it to be then i lowered the volume of the amplifier and pressed learn which displayed run now i was set to playin this mode automatic filters may get deployed and you will see the leds advance now here is the little trick if the filter lift led is off this means the automatic filters will remain in place until you turn the unit off or press reset but if you press learn increase the number of single shot filters and then press learn again you can get the unit to remember these new automatic filters as single shot filters again i have to say that the term single shot for a filter that is remembered until you press and hold reset is just an unfortunate term that breeds confusion the single shot filters are permanent and the automatic filters are temporary but they are a the same kind of filter and b temporary filters can be remembered by simply increasing the number of permanent filtersalso when we say the same kind of filter they single shot automatic peq are all the same kind of filter this is another source of confusion the unit doesnt do anything a  band peq couldnt do it just a sets the sliders itself by listening to the frequencies that are causing feedback and b has sliders that slide left and right in that they are not fixed at a certain frequency you get to set that as wellso again there is only one kind of filter and the setting of the peq and single shot count is just about managing themthe unit is reasonably quiet but in my case it did inject some hiss to be fair i am not using balanced inputsi personally cannot imagine using the unit as a peq because the interface is so awkward unless you somehow had a listing of what the settings ought to be and you were just manually entering them you have to select the slot then set a frequency a bandwidth and a positive or negative gain compare that to just moving a slider but again if the sliders are fixed at frequencies this unit will give you more flexibilityinitially in learn mode i ended up with four single shot filters while in run mode and while playing with filter lift off some additional filters would automatically get deployed which i added to the single shot count as described in my case i eventually got up to  single shot filters at this point i set filter lift to one minute so there would always be some automatic filters available and ive left it therepanic mode didnt seem to do as much as it should i still had to plug my ears and listen to my speakers howl far more than it seemed necessary before the unit finally kicked in while i can understand that while music is playing the fft algorithm might have a hard time determining what was music and what was feedback in automatic learning mode it sure seemed it ought to be able to tell a lot quicker than it did if you are automatically learning and the input to the unit is peaking to the point of clipping sure seems the unit ought to know feedback is occurringafter i figured out the confusing terminology aside from the degree to which my speakers had to squeal before the filter was deployed i really liked the unit that would be my primary complaint there ought to be a way unit to automatically attenuate or something to reduce the amount of time the speakers have to squeal before the filter is deployed and clipping at overload ought to be more polite and not generate square waves that sound so horrible and are so hard on the speakers at least while learning but is sure seems it could monitor input and compress so it would never overload or at least only overload momentarily there is no excuse for the unit to be overloading for seconds with the speakers cracklingso im deducting one star not for the confusion factor but for the overloading and noise issues every unit has it quirks and has to be learned im ignoring the ui involved in trying to use it as a peq factor all of that in and it is pretty much set calibrate and forgetfor the price less than half list this unit is a great value,behringer  professional automatic and ultrafast feedback destroyerparametric

B004NFTAPY,4.0,my wife and i bought this for our  year old son as a gift based on the video review where the guitar is shown as being playable i was also able to get our guitar to hold pitch and play but only because i am familiar with the basics of guitar setup and simple woodworkingi followed the advice given in the video review to use hard tension nylon strings and find that while they hold pitch the  string is too loose compared to the others to make a good sound perhaps this will improve as the strings stretch but experimenting with other strings may be worthwhilemy procedure remove all strings tailpiece nut and bridge file the headstock to create a level place to mount the nut the gap between  fret and nut was particularly large and uneven on the guitar we received so i also had to trim the fingerboard with a utility knife to make a clean straight edge at the top of the fingerboard reattach nut i used wood glue drill new hole to center tailpiece on body reattach tailpiece using the same screw place bridge i lightly glued it without too much concern for intonation securing it was more important for a two year old in my mind restring guitar loosening and then tightening phillips head screws on the tuning machines each time while adjusting pitch it simply wont hold pitch without them cranked down but wont turn without them loosei ended up with a guitar that looks a little better and sounds a lot better than what i had to start there are certainly many things wrong with it uneven frets bad string spacing lousy intonation but as a means to get our son involved in playing a guitar of his own instead of one of mine were pretty happy with it,star  string guitar right handed blue full ,0.91,0.5849673202614379,,,-213.74,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,129,40,119,40,191,67,169,67,0.88,0.4,0.31,0.31,4.36,1.48,129,37,42.8,42.3,0.68,0.82,6.6,9.33,0.93,30.53,0.7,0.89,35.56,4.22,0.24,0.65,0.18,0.04,0.22

B001LNN31S,5.0,mine was a ringer from the moment i touched it i havent actually used it for a single show and i try to weasel out of all recording sessions nowadays but ive used it on my own vanity projects and also i just pick it up a loti play for a living and am definitely in a neartotalburnout slump lately it feels like work just to pick up my own electric guitar at home and play music for any reason however picking up this guitar is always like going back to childhood its the guitar i really wanted when i was young  natural and beautiful and transparent and easy to playthe only real criticisms i can muster are true of all flamenco type guitars so discount them entirely if you want first the sustain is very short compared with a traditional classical guitar like eg an old ramirez  i forget what you call that construction style with the other kind of bracing so if you are thinking about playing classical repertoire and other styles on a single instrument the sustain may be unsatisfactory the flip side of that of course is that the instrument speaks very fast and intelligibly so its great for any music that is rhythmic or fast i have a very similar cordoba guitar thats built on the classical framework and i feel like i like the gk studio for songwriting fiddling around shedding on jazz improv  whatever i majored in guitar performance and i literally never play any of that old repertoire anymore if i want to hear that music i go to youtube and listen to the masters play itthe other universal nitpick is that some factory made realwood guitars are duds and some are ringers i think i would rather try a bunch of these irl and pick the ringerotoh if you cant tell it doesnt matter i dont know how most guitar players evaluate gear most things that are popularhighly reputed seem really poor to me this guitar model is an exception to me it seems like a great value even considering how much prices have come down over the yearsto get something this good  years ago you would have to  get financing and  go to guitar salon and pay through the nose for a famous luthier instrument now these guitars cost less than a lawnmower however ive gravitated toward a methodology of selecting instrument that considers price last  and the main pecuniary consideration is whats the most money i can lose on it if it doesnt work out eg for a high ticket item i generally buy used so that i can just flip it if it doesnt work out so imho its more direct to just identify the best few candidates irrespective of price and figure out which is best from those including how cumbersome it is to buyresell by those criteria this guitar is great because it works about as well as anything at any price and it is in the price category of a disposable consumer amusementoh i thought of one other nitpick the electronics are okay not great thats fine with me because most shows i play have less than worldclass sound reinforcement  plus i am never the star of the show im a sideman also i dont use this guitar for shows also when it comes to amplifying any kind of acoustic guitar imho there is an external highend microphone and then there is everything else i imagine people who need a real signature sound from onboard micpickuppre probably already have a favorite and they are going to have it installed in whatever they buy anyway so its hard to imagine this being a huge issue i will say that as lowend as the electronics are the preamp is very usable and tweak able to any situation on top of a notch filter and eq that is welltuned for the guitar the blend between piezo and mic has the effect of a sweepable mid control which would be handy in finding a place in a mix the piezo and mic have different characterresonances i liked the preamp well enough to find an aftermarket version that includes the same piezo and mic built into preamp chassis  not because its the most gorgeous sound ever but because it is simple and utile and sounds like a pluggedin guitar long story short the pre sounds weak compared to a good recording not compared with other guitars idk whats out there nowadays thats better after about  years of hearing that this new acoustic pickup is the one i stopped paying any attention at all afaik they are all pretty weakidk what strings i like on this guitar my relationship with it is so soothingly casual i liked the strings that came on it and i remember buying savarez strings idk which model at some point at a local store i just sat down now to scan these reviews to see which strings people put on this guitar  its time to change strings but my gig bag contained proart hard tension strings which i usually reserve for guitar that have weak attack or projection not an issue on this guitar seems amazing that i dont have favorite strings on my electrics i used to pencil on the back of the headstock the brand model and size strings i dont know what that says about the gk studio  i guess just that im always comfortable with it and it always sounds good,cordoba gk studio gipsy kings signature model acoustic electric nylon string flamenco

B0169Z51H6,5.0,firstly this product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review secondly this is a fine strap  at this price point i was not expecting much be was pleasantly surprised with this strap  i have more guitars than i currently have straps and honestly i will be picking up a few more of these for my knockaround guitars  the strap material is soft and tightly woven this is nice because it doesnt bite into my shoulder when playing  the description says that the ends are leather they are covered with a vinyl looking substance however there may be leather underneath  the holes for the strap buttons are easy to manipulate and appear to be stitched for reinforcement  oftentimes on cheaper straps i worry about the buttons pulling through the hole but i have not had this issue at all  the description says this is a bass strap but i have used it on  a few strat copies an epi sg a telecaster and my jaguar bass if i could find any negative about the strap is that there is a metal star emblem attached to one of the ends  i thought it was simply printed from the photo but it is an actual metal star  i say this because i dont like a bunch of metal around the finish of my guitars but its not something that cant be dealt with  bottom line for knockaround everyday playing guitars you cant beat it  would i gig with it with my les paulprobably not but for anything else i think its a fine strap  cant beat the price,donner  bass guitar strap density soft cotton  width thick leather end black,0.91,0.5148148148148148,,,-185.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,94,40,82,36,161,55,123,51,0.76,0.41,0.43,0.26,2.38,1.09,94,34,35.0,35.3,0.58,0.71,5.24,7.41,0.89,20.84,0.67,0.79,21.44,3.27,0.22,0.6,0.14,0.03,0.17

B01BDX1IVW,1.0,was very excited to try these because of the great reviews and the price however even at low cost im disappointed at how mediocre these performed sound was decent for the most part but suffered a lot at lower frequencies for example it struggled pushing clear rich sound for drum beats unless i changed my equalizer settings another big issue was poor grip the right slider was basically stuck but i i didnt care too much since the left worked fine and i was able to adjust the length perhaps this is why it didnt sit snug on my head on a related note asked my officemate if he could hear me and he said he could starting at windows volume level  maybe i received a defective unitwhile very comfortable on the ears i am hesitant to buy again even if they are going at ,status audio  closed back studio monitor headphones,7.43,0.7103448275862069,145.0,8.529411764705882,-58.79,145,1,23,17,1,9,1,3,17,145.0,145.0,8.5294,17.0,23.0,17.0,0.5294,9.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,0.1765,17.0,1.0,75,22,68,21,92,23,77,22,0.84,0.29,0.29,0.14,0.43,0.46,75,43,42.3,42.5,0.82,0.86,5.53,7.82,0.95,43.46,0.88,0.9,17.19,2.93,0.25,0.93,0.27,0.03,0.3

B003H95272,5.0,i have several of the standard length  inch high versions model  of this stand  i use them professionally almost every day in the studio and onlocation and could not be happier with their performance and reliability  they cost a little more than the similar appearing stands made by onstage musicians gear samson and ultimate but are made to a very high standard and work every timethe km folding stands are used by many pro engineers for a reason  they just work right  they are made of fine materials everything is well machined so everything fits they have a precision feel and they last foreverthe only downside of this design is that the stands are fairly heavy  this is not an issue in a studio situation in fact the weight of the base casting actually adds to the stands stability  however if you have to carry  or  of these to an onlocation gig the weight is not appreciatedfor situations where i need higher mic placement i still love my old shure  and sometimes i will chose my ultimate squeeze grip stands for vocal mics but the cheaper musician gear and onstage stands are kept around only for the rare situations when i need a large number of mics or as backups  once you use a km mic stand or a km music stand going back to a cheap chinese stand is like switching from driving a new bmw to a used hyundai  no offense to hyundai or even onstage but the few bucks more that the km costs is a tiny price to pay for the improved quality and will be paid back many times over during the extended life of the product,kampm stands low level microphoneboom stand,78.13,0.5602836879432624,,,-197.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,113,36,105,35,177,48,152,47,0.86,0.31,0.32,0.16,0.81,0.64,113,41,40.8,39.2,0.64,0.78,6.01,8.49,0.91,25.93,0.69,0.77,18.58,3.05,0.16,0.7,0.18,0.08,0.26

B002BO53LO,5.0,i run sound at my church and we bought this for the pastor to use and we have used it for almost a year  sound is good and our pastor really likes how much more securely the earpiece holds in place than the cheaper pyle pro earpieces we had been using in the past  the pyle pro earpieces would slip enough that our pastor would have to adjust it several times during a service  since using this i dont think he has had to adjust it once during a service  i originally was hesitant to buy this because of the price but it has been worth it because of the more secure fiti learned one lesson the hard way  we are using this with a shure body pack transmitter so we had to use one of the included adaptors  i had read another review where someone said you should tape the adapter to the plug from the earpiece to make sure they didnt come apart  well i didnt have time to tape them together before the first time we used it and sure enough the plug pulled out of the adaptor causing some crackling and popping  i taped the adaptor to the plug after our first church service and it has worked flawlessly ever since  please dont make the same mistake i did if you have to use an adaptorone other positive note  the wire on the pyle pro earpieces we had used before would break right at the strain relief after about  months so we would have to replace them  so far this one has not had a problem and even if it does you can buy a replacement cable rather than replace the whole earpiece,samson  earset microphone with microminiature condenser capsule,22.99,0.5156794425087108,,,-194.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,97,28,83,27,163,46,129,45,0.79,0.35,0.29,0.08,0.24,0.35,97,33,37.3,37.7,0.6,0.76,5.37,7.6,0.9,21.71,0.64,0.59,13.08,2.56,0.17,0.64,0.15,0.05,0.2

B0002GLM90,3.0,i was given a modified version of this guitar from my soninlaw as a birthday gift he buys inexpensive guitars and tweaks them a bit to make them better just a little history first i own a gibson les paul a fender strat and a fender tele american made guitars so i was a little skeptical when i noticed it was made in indonesia yesi guess i am a made in america snob  particularly when it comes to electric guitars because i have noticed a few things about guitars made overseas first of all  i have found that guitars manufactured overseas use inferior electrical components to keep the cost down no big surprise there although the guitar bodies and the overall appearance are usually pretty good however the feel of the neck and the action are noticeably different making them difficult to play to me  the neck feels thick and awkward and chording becomes very cumbersome whereas an american made guitar neck just fits your hand like a glove of course it depends on the manufacture and individual preference but for the most part the difference is like day and night however you pay dearly for that fits like a glove feel anyway my soninlaw took this guitar and upgraded the pickups with seymour duncan paf humbuckers  then replaced the electronics with pushpull  potentiometers for series parallel switching i dont claim to know exactly how the electronics work  but the sound is incredible i had always thought about purchasing an epiphone casino one day  but this guitar filled that spot and then some the really good thing about this guitar is the neck action and the guitar body are good in comparison to other guitars manufactured in indonesia  if youre not in a position to spend a lot of money on a guitar and you just want something that you can learn to play or perhaps get back into playing this guitar might be a good fit for you besides that you dont have to break the bank in process later on  when the guitar bug bites you again and it will you can replace the electronics to something better and have yourself a guitar you can really be proud to own thats my take and no i am not an employee of washburn guitars,washburn oscar schmidt  semihollow body electric guitar  tobacco sunburst,55.08,0.522077922077922,,,-310.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,144,54,134,53,232,82,202,81,0.87,0.4,0.38,0.2,1.84,0.96,144,37,40.2,40.4,0.62,0.82,6.69,9.45,0.91,27.02,0.66,0.77,26.27,3.62,0.17,0.62,0.15,0.06,0.21

B004KE2D84,5.0,for newbies to lap steel i can offer a few pointers  im a newbie too but after looking at steel guitars for many years i have finally gotten into a systematic learning mode over the last several months  im studying the basics using the powerslidethe construction of the powerslide is pretty basic  but electric steel guitars were basic back in the heyday of the    too  you could build one yourself without too much problem but functional nonpedal steels are so inexpensive why bother  vintage lap steels are easy to find on amazon and ebay but i prefer not to be burdened with the responsibility of an heirloom if its in good condition  if its not in good condition thats a project in itselfthe powerslide features a modern humbucker pickup which i think is preferable to either a lone single coil or the archaic horseshoe pickup of the old days  you can back off the  coil of the pickup for a more treblely single coil sound thats the tone control  works great for meon the steel guitar forum i learned that some of the earlier models including mine set the nut at  from the bridge but the printed fretboard is designed for  same as a les paul right  its not too much of a problem if youve got good ears  sgf suggested moving the nut forward  and ill be doing that very soon  its a sloppy production error but looking at the guitar one can understand how this happened  it also appears quite easy to fix with careful measurement and a hand drill  by this date  you probably wont find this issue on a new instrumentthe powerslide includes a steel which is something of a hybrid between a steel tube slide and a stevens bar  you can get by with it but dont be shy to try more traditional alternatives such as the bullet bar or a real stevens  the gigbag case is not exciting but having it is much better than not having itsteel guitar offers almost unlimited open tuning possibilities but to get anywhere with the instrument youve got to choose one and learn it  peavey suggests ebegbe tuning same as a basic e chord on a regular guitar but there are many others depending on what you wish to do  im using a major  low bass eaeace because some very interesting old as in prewar books use the tuning  some of these books use conventional notation and some provide notation plus tablature  if i can learn to read regular notation on the instrument thats a good thing  i definitely prefer the kamiki method book check amazon definitely over the mel bay  roger filiberto method in  bdegbeall the tunings have limitations pick a simple one to start  but try to match the strings to their open pitches  lorene ruymars book includes a list of string gauges matched to pitch  dig around on the web for that or buy her book  if you buy an old fender or similar beware of overtensioning the strings as this can damage the tuning machines and they are hard to replace  correctly tensioned strings will greatly enhance the tonelast bit on the peavey ive abandoned the stand while you play approach for now and i find having the guitar on my lap rather confining  i practice with the instrument on an table with adjustable legs a keyboard stand and plank would likely work too  ive noticed a few entry level steels such as rogue include legs so thats something to consider  legs make the guitar more akin to the console steels which look like pedal steels but wo the pedalsand why not a pedal steel  they are said to be a much more complicated bit of hardware  you get more harmonic capability at the cost of increased complexity in playing and physical setup  such challenges will have to wait,peavey  string guitar right handed ,63.96,0.4992248062015504,,,-574.75,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,246,110,231,107,399,158,346,154,0.87,0.45,0.45,0.22,4.64,1.52,246,38,44.6,41.9,0.62,0.86,8.71,12.32,0.92,32.21,0.67,0.68,44.47,4.72,0.19,0.68,0.16,0.03,0.19

B000NHB9BE,4.0,i lost my longtime aframe style stand for my electric bass and have been in the hunt for a replacement my old stand like this one  was very sturdy and stable but it was large and did not fold up much smaller than is fully deployed sizein my search i was primarily looking at the neck hanging style of stands like the ultimate  hercules  and the hamilton  each of them had some glaring weaknesses that made me unsure of their long term suitability the ultimate  has known issues where the twist lock becomes worn and unlocks with the slightest weight applied the hercules stands have issues with the plastic trigger locks breaking and i wasnt impressed by the overlycomplicated auto grip yoke system the hamilton stands have issues with the rubber padding wearing through quickly and damaging the instrumentall these concerns made me expand my search initially i did not like the idea of a ministand like this one it seemed like it would be too easy to knock the instrument over without any neck support present in actual usage however im surprised at how stable it seems i tried knocking my bass off in multiple directions and only strong blows from the side even came close to toppling it i did notice that tugging on the strap made it more prone to falling so that may be a weak spotover all my initial impressions are positive it is lightweight packs small is all solid metal where is counts and is surprisingly stable for its designi wish hercules would make a similar stand but extend the vertical tube up taller and use yoke for the neck similar to the one in their shock stand  i also had concerns about the locking button i the vertical support the thin stamped metal button bears the entire load from the instrument and if it fails or isnt seated properly the instrument would fall i didnt actually experience any problems but i decide to mod the stand by removing the button and drilling a hole all the way through so i could use a wire lock pin see the last photo attached with this mod im very pleased with his standi highly recommend this item even though it may not be perfect in all applications it is working well for me,hercules  mini electric stand with bag,6.04,0.5555555555555556,,,-304.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,159,68,147,67,237,81,202,79,0.85,0.39,0.43,0.21,2.33,1.08,159,41,43.5,43.8,0.67,0.85,7.3,10.33,0.93,32.53,0.73,0.81,33.92,4.12,0.21,0.72,0.16,0.05,0.21

B008UYZBG6,5.0,this is not my first wampler pedal i have an ecstasy and a paisley od and both are top notch pedals this one is no different i purchased it to take the place of my blues pearl perplexed which is another marshall in a box type of pedal that is also loosely based on the marshall guvnor that pedal has not been produced in  years and has a big footprinti was able to get a near exact tone with the pinnacle by manipulating the tone and contour being that the perplexed has a bass mid and treble control it goes to show just how versatile the contour control really isbut the pedal can do so much more while i prefer the warm mids of the vintage mode the modern mode will give you a brighter edge suitable for  thrash metal through modern rock there is a ton of gain on tap even without the boost and plenty of volume to kick the front end of an ampbut i ended exchanging the pedal for the deluxe model the main reason is that with the gain at anywhere above  kicking in the boost does add hiss expected for this much gain so i wanted to be able to control it with the pedal to kick it off and the noise during quiet parts of our songs also it is just so much more handy having the boost on a footswitch for lead boosts not only does it give you a slight kick in volume but it gives you that stacked od pedals butter lead sound with infinite sustain having the boost on the pedal allows me to just use this one pedal on by board for rhythm and lead od sounds where before id use a second tube screamer type pedal afterward to boost mids and volume for leadsoverall you cant go wrong with this pedal but if you do want the versatility of having a dynamic od for rhythm plus a super compressed od for leads think about the deluxe model,wampler pedals pinnacledeluxe amp in a box pinnacle deluxe distortion pedal,55.09,0.5117647058823529,,,-248.25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,118,52,111,50,202,79,171,76,0.85,0.44,0.44,0.25,2.5,1.12,118,36,40.7,37.3,0.58,0.78,5.87,8.3,0.9,22.76,0.65,0.78,24.02,3.47,0.18,0.64,0.16,0.04,0.2

B000EEJGRK,5.0,love this guitar hanger  im using it for a  fender jazz bass  i bought this to replace an ultimate  wall hanger  i have the foldable ultimate  that i use for gigs which i love so when i wanted a wall hanger to clear by home studio floor i went with the ultimate support  wall hanger that comes with a retaining strap i quickly found that ultimate  has a design flaw not present in the hercules   the ultimate hanger arms are rigid and horizontally even  to remove your instrument you lift and twist your instrument within the arms to remove it from the rack  the problem is that if the headstock on your instrument isnt uniform on both sides the instrument given the slightest touch tends to slowly twist within the arms loosing their support with only the retaining strap keeping your instrument from crashing to the floor  i didnt feel comfortable with this so i purchased the hercules wallmountnow as most reviewers have suggested use your own heartier wall anchors and screws to install dont feel that the ones that came with the wallmount offer enough gripping power  upon installing i was uncomfortable with the fact that the assembly from which my bass hangs was twisting fairly easily on the mounting plate tube  the fact is that this free movement on the mounting plate tube is what allows the arms to swivel to find the best position at which to uniformly grip the sides of the headstock of your instrument before using the weight of your instrument to engage the retaining tabs at the front of the arm my bass sits rock steady within the arms no twisting no anxiety that my bass will fall out and a breeze to remove from the wallmount for a quick jamnone of this is explained on the packaging so i thought i share this will other musicians so that you too can enjoy a great product,hercules stands wallmount guitar hanger ,21.99,0.49226006191950467,,,-239.46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,120,50,113,50,188,70,172,70,0.91,0.41,0.42,0.28,3.67,1.36,120,33,40.5,37.8,0.64,0.77,6.19,8.75,0.91,26.53,0.66,0.76,26.63,3.65,0.2,0.61,0.11,0.03,0.14

B0002D0EC4,5.0,so i had the gilmour black strat setup but the fender fat  were not taking distortion very well or high end pedals like thorpy  i loved how it sounded clean though but i just got tired of the weird wobble effect by the magnetic pull of the pups so i decided to go with sonethibg like a humbucker i didnt want to lose the stratiness of my guitar so i got a duckbucker for the middle which the say if you put it in between two higher output pickups you get the quack and twang i left the bridge intact with the  the neck has always been my favorite position  i love warmer tones i did lose some chime and bell tones with the little  but man this pickup has a lot of balls very nice output very nice cleans and best of all it takes all my pedals like a champ super smooth and amazing fuzz overdrive or distortion as promised the duckbucker gives me the strat tones from position  and down position  sound similar to the  but with more high end sparkle i was impressed by this pickup and im still getting used to it and experimenting but it definitely feels like the best of both worlds i was ready to start using my les paul even though i was missing the whammy bar but now i basically have a les paul on the neck and a strat on the lower positions and i can still use the tremolo arm even on the  les paul position  overall i think it would be extremely difficult to not likelove this pickup like i said i did lose low end sparkle and chime so it definitely does not sound like a single coil but its silent and has all the qualities of a humbucker  i no longer have the gilmour setup but thats a good thing my guitar now looks a bit different changed a few knobs to black and now it sounds completaly different i am stoked and cant wait to record and hear how it sounds,seymour duncan little  pickup white neck,8.65,0.5129682997118156,,,-255.36,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,125,51,116,49,216,70,190,68,0.88,0.36,0.41,0.15,1.02,0.71,125,43,41.2,41.8,0.58,0.83,6.01,8.51,0.9,22.94,0.61,0.65,20.02,3.16,0.16,0.6,0.14,0.04,0.18

B000NPIA4A,4.0,there are a lot of wireless mics on the market and many of them are very expensive  i decided to take a chance with this unit and was pleasantly surprised  the construction and design is very nice  having  channels is fantastic  this was purchased for our church and we noticed one issue  if the mics are off then the receiver will sometimes pick up stray signals that could get into the mixer if the mixer channel is turned up  as long as the mics were on then there was not a problem  there is a mute option on the mic and that works well  as long as the mic is on muted or note then the receiver was quiet  the manual is not clear with all the options but i found that doubleclicking the button on the mic provides different options  the little receiver has a connection bar that allows you to connect  receivers together which then will let you mount the unit into a rack mount for a total of  mics  also each mic can be controlled by a separate mixer channel if using the xlr connection but you can use the lineout connection and get a mix of both channels which can feed into one mixer channel,hisonic   dual uhf  wireless microphone fcc certified,45.14,0.5263157894736842,209.0,7.7407407407407405,-123.75,209,1,33,27,1,15,1,5,17,209.0,209.0,7.7407,27.0,33.0,27.0,0.5556,15.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.1852,17.0,0.6296,72,18,64,18,120,31,94,31,0.78,0.33,0.25,0.14,0.41,0.45,72,37,37.3,33.8,0.6,0.72,4.65,6.57,0.89,19.49,0.68,0.91,18.18,3.02,0.21,0.58,0.15,0.05,0.2

B009HUM11K,4.0,with one notable exception i am very happy with the bose  series including this   systemnote that i purchased a second  bass module as well as a  mixer and ill include them in this reviewthe first thing that struck me as i unpacked it and assembled it is that the system screams qualityeverything is built like a tank  im amazed at how they can keep the weight reasonable while still using such solid constructioneven the connecting cords are thick and the connectors are highly professional latching to their mating parts easily but securelywith one exception this is obviously an extremely highquality professional systemive played in and done sound for serious small bands for almost  years and ive never used equipment this impressive in constructionmy one and only disappointment in quality and its a big one came when i attempted to fasten the  module to the speaker towertheir attachment method is absolutely insane  the  has a tiny shallow hole which mates with a stubby little peg on the tower bracketthe  which ultimately has five heavy cords coming out of it just sort of sits there balanced with only the slightest security obtained from pressing the short peg into the shallow holei connected just one mic cable and as i was starting to unroll the cable the  came loose and plunged toward the floorluckily i was still standing there and i managed to snatch it out of midair before it hitthis is crazy  the interconnecting cables fasten so securely that a gorilla could not pull them free  the tower sections snap together equally securely and the  modules sit nicely in perfectly sized sections of the standthen we have the  mixer the only part that has stage cables coming out all over the place and its not much more than balanced on a bracket  unbelievableso now i mount the  low practically touching the  modules so when it inevitably falls whenever a mic cable twitches it doesnt have far to falli will say that when i called bose they told me i had a defect and immediately shipped me a new one  but the replacement was identical to the first  its not a defective part its a major design flawmy second relatively minor but annoying disappointment came when i connected our equipment and cranked the volumethe sound quality is excellent at modest volumes but their suitable for crowd size up to  is wildly optimistici suppose that may be somewhat realistic if you are playing soft acousticstyle music in a wonderful little hall where everyone is listening intently and in utter silencebut shortly after it arrived we played a wedding reception in a small vfw hall with about  people eating dinner and talkingeven with the volume up almost to the distortion point and the second optional  we could barely be heard at the back of the roomin summary this system is perfect for you if like me you are getting older and system weight is an issue  this   breaks down into components about  ponds each half the weight of my old system you play acousticstyle music which requires the best possible reproduction of the subtle nuances of your instruments  the sound quality up to modest volume is excellent you dont require much volume because you play smallish coffeehousetype venues with a quiet audience who does not want rockband volume you are willing to pay a very premium price for all of this  a powered mixer and a pair of decent speakers will give you more input channels and a lot more volume for much less costone last point dont buy the   it is profoundly overpriced for what it does  just get a little mackie mixer for  the priceand its not just the price  having to select a channel push a button and an effect turn a knob and make an adjustment turn another knob every time you want to make a quick small change is a royal painwith a real mixer board if midconcert you decide you want to cut the treble on the vocalist a bit you just twist the hieq knob down a bitbut with the  you have to push the button for the vocal channel turn the selection knob to the eq choice and then twiddle with the parameter knob  very distracting and timeconsumingi had planned to sell my old system when i got this one but after the first use i decided to keep the old system for larger venueseven with the second optional  module the volume is insufficient for some of our gigstim,bose  model is single  bass system,184.99,0.4920212765957447,,,-683.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,288,136,273,134,454,165,398,163,0.88,0.41,0.47,0.24,5.88,1.71,288,43,43.9,43.3,0.63,0.87,9.56,13.52,0.93,35.72,0.69,0.73,52.9,5.14,0.18,0.67,0.17,0.06,0.23

B0052B9LGQ,5.0,so far ive used the  primarily to record my band live at practices and when we play out so i havent used many of the features  that said i find the sound quality very good and its very compact and convenient to use  ive not tried to tie it directly into software i use logic express  its easy enough to read the sdcard copy the audio files straight into the programs once i get to that point recordingusing the  track mode is straightforward pretty much out of the box for anyone whos had any multitrack recording experience  the input jacks are combined xlr and  phone and are at least in my system a tight fit for connecting disconnecting cables  i use a series of splitters xlr and or  y splitters so that instruments vocals can be sent to the  and the mixing board pa  so far this has worked well  if you want to record directly from a guitar bass theres a hi z switch on track input  only  there are phantom power options on other channelsin addition to direct inputs the builtin condenser mics also work surprisingly well for live recording but obviously without the ability to change the mix beyond the  channelsive used it with rechargeable batteries nimh and theyve lasted about  sets so a bit over  hour of recording on  tracks playbackthere are several ways to get decent output  the ones ive tried so far are mix from the board through the stereo lineout or phones output jacks  great for rough takes copy the audio files from the sd card to a computer and import them into editing software eg audacity or logic expresswhen playing back the use of effects is more confusing that imo it needs to be as there are different types of effects that can be applied to each channel and or input with some limitations that are confusing  imo this highlights what for me is the biggest liability the manual  fortunately there are some great youtube tutorials that go in to excellent detail on a variety of functions  my favorite is by topdazzle who explained in less than a minute what the  manual couldnt at least to me in multiple pages wrt the use of sendreturn rather than insert effects  these tutorials might also give a good intro for those considering buying oneimo an excellent piece of kit though with its plastic casing be careful not to abuse it,zoom  multitrack sd recorder controller and interface,63.95,0.5689655172413793,,,-332.16,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,176,73,163,69,251,86,215,82,0.86,0.38,0.41,0.22,2.67,1.15,176,41,44.1,44.3,0.7,0.87,7.86,11.11,0.94,37.35,0.76,0.74,29.63,3.85,0.19,0.86,0.17,0.05,0.22

B00B5LBN7C,4.0,the takemine  is a truely lovely guitar it was a little dirty coming out of the box it was a waxy like buildup on the fretboard caked on at the edges of the frets it also had a very small patch on the back side of the neck that was just slightly rough a good cleaning and polishing pad took care of it in less than a minute it also had a small section of binding on the backside of the cutaway about an inch long that was worn through the clear coat propaply happened at the manufacturer during the final polishing with the indusrtrial buffer wheel really hard to notice anyway but two minutes with my polishing pad and you cant even tell however the guitars overall quality and condition was and is excellenti feel it is important to note that ups delivered my guitar and i was not happy about their service as it arrived at my home i had seen them pull up to the house and so opened the door as the driver brought the package up to the door he failed to pay attention and literally slammed the box into the concrete steps as he began climbing themthere are only two steps he then pushed the box at me which was mashed at one end turned and went back to his truck without so much as a word let alone a signature like i said not happy who knows how they treated it throughout the rest of the shipping process though it was packed well and nothing was brokenok back to the important part of thisthe guitarim not a big fan of the dadarrio exp bronze coated strings that come on the guitar they are ok strings though a little rough on my fingers and i find them a little duller in tone than i prefer since she needed a good cleaning anyway i pulled the strings and replaced them with a set of light gauge elixir polywebs and she sounds awesome great resonance tone harmonics warmth really a very lovely sound nice bright clean and crispthe preamp  tuner is great tuner is spot on and she sounds awesome plugged in though my preference is still acoustic easy to use  eq nice sized gain knob makes adjustments easy and precise easy and intuative tunner display that turns itself off after just a few minutes to save your battery and the quick battery change access cover is a nice addition as well battery was included the pickups are the undersaddle variety in fact the saddles actually clip into the pickup right inside the saddle slot of the bridge direct tone feedbackawesomethe most impressive part to me was the way she came set up out of the box perfect couldnt have been better neck was spot on saddle adjustment was spot on and the nut was notched spot on this gives the guitar a wonderfully low action nice and fast easy on the fingers with great inntonation really great work i can do all of that work myself and regularlly do so of others as well i am very focused on the details and strive for the best results possible i didnt need to do any adjustments to this guitar she played liked a dream right out of the boxthe neck is not gloss coated it is a flat finish with no clear coat and has been treated with tung oil i love it it keeps the neck smooth when playing even if your hands get a little moistthe solid spruce top is beautiful and elegant and still provides great tonal qualities the craftsmanship is excellent you can barely see the seam between the two piecesthe mahogany back and sides are absoluetly beautiful this really is a lovely guitar do yourself a favor and give takemine a try you wont regret itthe new thread through bridge style they are using is nice and easy to use though if you have fat fingers youll want a pair of needle nose pliars during string changes to help get the strings up over the saddles as you thread through its a simple design that looks and helps make the guitar sound greatthe duel saddle is an awesome addition that really helps with the innotation and turns the undersaddle pickup into two seperate pickups so your b and high e string have their own pickup it really makes those high notes ring when shes plugged ini have been fortunate enough to spend some time with a few other models of takemine recently the  which is takemines nex body style of this same guitar still beautiful with great tone just a little smaller body style great for someone that find the dreanought a little bit big the other was an  in their higher end guitars discontinued now and to this day is probably the nicest acoustic guitar i have ever played seriously though they have something in about every price range give them a look and give one a try you wont regret itso to sum upissuesdirty guitar small

B001BSEIUS,5.0,let me give you a bit of background  ive used a  for several years  when it failed i sent it back to motu and received a rebuilt modern  in return  i found that the new circuitry was harsh than i expected and decided i needed something a bit better  so i set out to buy an at some point in the discussion with the salesman it occurred to me that the  wasnt all that much more expensive and offered some significant advantages   preamps instead of two and a whole bunch of other inputs as well  so i gritted my teeth and sprang for the   and have never had reason to question my decision sinceinstallation was simple  connect the  to my mac pro with firewire turn everything on and watch the cuemix console come up  pop in a sound source and let it go  the sound at  recording is perfect and the preamps are clean and clear  eq dynamics and reverb work as advertised  for sound recording and internal mixing it would be hard to beat what the  does for digital soundon the down side i found using the front panel for control a bit clumsy  the cuemix console is much easier but doesnt let you fiddle with some of the features like the programmable meters  for my purposes this isnt an issue but if you intend to take the  out in the field keep this in mind that  of course like anything if you have to use it a lot it will get easierim going with  stars  the  is exactly what it says it is and a bit more  this is not the best dac in the world but it competes head on with equipment that can cost  to  times as much  for hte serious nonprofessional its hard to beat,motu  hybrid,12.47,0.56,,,-216.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,131,42,120,42,169,46,142,46,0.84,0.32,0.32,0.17,1.23,0.78,131,45,44.4,44.6,0.78,0.9,7.13,10.08,0.95,44.87,0.85,0.85,28.9,3.8,0.24,0.85,0.21,0.02,0.23
B001VO7ACA,5.0,my first recorder was the yamaha  soprano  which is great and sounds lovely i saw a lot of reviewers recommending aulos so i thought i would give it a try one great thing about recorders is that they are so cheap the aulos also sounds fantastic the aulos has a slightly darkerwarmer tone than my yamaha soprano which has no woodgrain it is also a little longer lengthwise though the fingering holes are the same distance apart in terms of playability they are comparableintonation is good on both and they are both expressive if you are new to the recorder the low and high notes will be harder but that is to be expected the bottom notes on the aulos are a smidgen easier to play than the yamaha on the other hand it does seem that the top notes are a little thinner on the aulos vs the yamaha but i am a new player and also havent spent much time with the aulos yetthe fake woodgrain is a plus the simulated woodgrain on the aulos soprano looks much better than bare plastic of my yamaha soprano though i also bought a yamaha alto recorder in woodgrain and i would say the yamaha woodgrain is slightly better  it has a bit more texture and more of a cherry tone on both i find the woodgrain makes the recorder less slippery and easier to hold so i am only going to get recorders with this treatment from now onthe aulos recorder comes with a pleather bag a bit nicer than the canvas one that comes with a yamaha a stick to clean the instrument and a thumbrest unlike the yamahas this aulos did not include recorder grease the manual recommends vegetable greaseoverall great recorder,aulos  haka sopranodescant recorder,7.99,0.46938775510204084,,,-210.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,102,37,95,36,181,67,146,66,0.81,0.45,0.36,0.12,0.36,0.42,102,34,37.5,34.7,0.56,0.69,5.36,7.58,0.89,20.46,0.65,0.84,17.64,2.97,0.14,0.56,0.21,0.03,0.24

B00501IST4,5.0,i ordered this saxophone for my  grade daughter to use in her school band class  im not expert enough to speak to other situations but if youre considering purchasing this saxophone for a young beginning player i highly recommend it  two reasons  im familiar with other instruments but knowknew next to nothing about the sax so i asked my daughter to have her teacher give me an honest opinion  the music teacher said that for a beginning musician this sax is more than adequate he felt that it was probably good enough to last a musician into high school band  again while a serious experienced saxophonist would probably want a better horn the mendini by cicilio is fine for a beginner  the cost as compared to renting from my local music store  obviously this will vary from place to place but i live in utah where things tend to be comparatively inexpensive  that said to rent my daughter a sax would have been  a month  we could return it any time or after paying  we would have owned it  but at a minimum we would have needed the rental for nine monthsone school yearfor a total cost of   thats about  more than it cost to purchase a sax outright  yes the rental was a better quality yamaha but see reason  above for why that doesnt matter  the only benefit to renting was free repairs but unless someone is seriously careless with the instrument thats not going to cost anywhere near   in other words as counterintuitive as it seems it was much cheaper to buy this saxophone than it would have been to rent one for a single scholastic year  this doesnt even consider the  free reeds they run about  each retail or the tunermetronome like the saxnot top quality but certainly good enough to get you started probably a  value  the only hardware id suggest upgrading immediately is the neck strap  the one included is uncomfortable and has actually come unhooked a couple times just by the weight of the instrumentto sum up  this is a very decent saxophone for a very low price much lower than anything else i could find  i am extremely satisfied with this purchase as is my daughter the nascent saxophonist  it still sounds like an angry goose when she plays but her teacher assures me shes doing fine and that she has a good instrument to learn on,mendini by cecilio  purple lacquer e flat alto saxophone with tuner case mouthpiece  reeds and more,55.08,0.5420792079207921,,,-330.13,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,159,51,150,50,239,65,203,64,0.85,0.32,0.32,0.21,2.33,1.08,159,41,43.6,43.2,0.67,0.86,7.27,10.28,0.93,31.96,0.74,0.9,42.48,4.61,0.23,0.69,0.19,0.07,0.26

B0017OS7JY,4.0,the shubb axys is an excellent design like their other products but be aware that if you have large hands this may not fit you  even with the largest insert it wont fit over my ring finger knuckle and my hands are probably only a little larger than average  however in fairness my knuckles are probably larger than most  the only way i can fit it on my ring finger is to not use any of the inserts but then it wont rotate with one hand and thats its claim to fame  but if you hands are small to average size and you dont have large knuckles you will probably be delighted with this excellent product  on the other hand if you  have very large hands or large knuckles this will work for you i can fit it over my little finger with the  largest insert but using a slide on that finger doesnt seem natural to me and its virtually impossible to rotate it as it is designed to rotate when on the little finger  but the folks at shubb are classacts and when i let them know that it didnt fit just for feedback that i thought they might find useful they responded almost instantly and even offered to buy it back from me  so as long as your hands or knuckles arent large buy with confidence you will love it,shubb ax axyx reversable slide,4.0,0.4892703862660944,,,-139.65,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,69,20,61,20,129,30,108,30,0.84,0.28,0.29,0.3,2.37,1.09,69,31,36.2,35.7,0.53,0.67,4.3,6.08,0.87,16.39,0.56,0.81,17.93,2.99,0.2,0.53,0.16,0.09,0.25

B015XD4YLY,5.0,i have played the guitar banjo and bass for a few years now and i was looking to add to my collection of stringed instruments after careful research this seemed to be the best balance of quality and price for a ukulele ever since i first strummed it i have not been able to put it down literally i simply cant get enough of the heavenly sound and rich warm tone that the aquila strings have over the mahoganysapele body not only am i blown away by the great tone but also the projection and fullness of the sound are fantastic due to the arched back the tuning of the instrument has held up amazing even after only  days this is especially amazing considering that ukuleles typically have to go through a break in period as well as in my case deal with the july humidity in alabama the encased chrome tuners look nice as well another great addition is the preinstalled strap buttons which saves me  to  aesthetically speaking the ukulele overall is gorgeous and everything from the strap to the trim compliments each other the wood grain in the picture seems to be a bit sharper than mine but i like the mellowed coloration of mine morein terms of the accessories they are definitely icing on the cake the extra set of aquila nylon strings is very much appreciated especially considering theyre the best in the business the strap is very useful while playing keeping it more anchored as well as making it more comfortable compared to other strap configurations the picks are different thicknesses which is ideal the tuner is surprisingly very nice i have been using it on my other instruments as well just be sure that once you turn it on press the power button until it says uc at the bottom for ukulele the bag was actually better than i thought with respectable padding instead of just a canvas coveringoverall this thing plays like a  to  ukulele plus you simply cant beat the lifetime warranty and trust me i have no connection with lohanu they really seem to have hit the sweet spot with this one now i have the electric cutaway version of this on the way,ukulele concert size bundle from lohanu luc  strap pins installed free uke strap case tuner picks pick holder aquila strings installed free video lessons,14.99,0.5588235294117647,,,-291.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,161,62,144,60,238,74,189,72,0.79,0.38,0.39,0.2,1.4,0.84,161,42,42.7,40.7,0.68,0.86,7.38,10.44,0.93,33.27,0.76,0.83,24.03,3.47,0.15,0.82,0.2,0.08,0.28
B0007Y8GSM,5.0,these  egg shakers came at a bargain price and are made by a reputible percussion companyi use them for minor percussion while listening to or playing music and plan to use them for studio and meditative reasons  they are all clearly labeled by sound level  they each carry a distinct tone so if you are using them all at the same time you can pick their sound out individually  the red and black are the loud and extra loud eggs and they have a tinny sound  for my personal preference i use and like the white and grey eggs the most  they have soft sounds especially the white and are much more soothing than rattling on the ears it all depends on what sound you are going for  holding the egg sideways and swishing it back and forth can create a much quieter sound from the louder eggs that can be more soothing that normally shaking themthe shape of the eggs makes them fairly versatile  there is so much more one can do with these shakers than you would believe  remember that the sound depends on not just the product but how you hold and handle it i would recommend this to any musician for studio or jam session use  it would also be a nice addition to a drum circle and would add a nice touch to a minor percussion set or music teachers inventory  i would think it should also make for great meditative use especially the white egg  this would also suffice as an amusing toy for a child of any age and it seems safe for biting throwing stomping etc as the shell is very durable  i would caution that its advertised use is specifically for percussion though  the contents of the egg are no doubt harmful to children if they find a way out of the shellbuy it the price is a value and it makes for a fun addition to every day life,meinl percussion artist series shaker luis conte signaturenot made in chinasoft volume for recording sessions and live acoustic shows  warranty ,0.91,0.5106382978723404,,,-245.55,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,115,39,108,38,178,48,151,47,0.85,0.31,0.34,0.18,1.29,0.8,115,40,40.9,41.7,0.65,0.81,6.09,8.62,0.92,26.69,0.72,0.79,23.68,3.44,0.2,0.66,0.16,0.05,0.21
