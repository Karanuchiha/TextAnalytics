B002LLJ0W0,4.0,this program is exactly what the title says it is it gives a pretty good introduction to guitar playing most of the songs have an option to view a picture of the top of the fret board while someone else is playing the song what i dont like about this feature is that the fingers show up as simple dots and dont really show how a persons hand is supposed to move for the chord changes this program also gives the option to watch someone else play the song which sounds like a great idea but it really doesnt add much my biggest problem with guitars is that i cannot figure out what i am doing wrong in some sections i was really hopping that the feature where you get to watch someone else play would help me figure it out what i really learned is that wrong or right people look the same playing the guitar this program does not help you figure out problems if you started from a cold start not knowing anything as the title says for dummies then this might have worked better for me but im not sure i wouldnt have run into the same problems previous programs by emedia have allowed for the option of plugging in a midi device that allows the program to test and tell you based on what you are playing if you are doing something right i was really looking forward to being able to use that on this program however there is no such thing on this program i felt that was a draw back to other emedia programs and this product is made by emedia and for dummies so i felt that was disapointing the other problem with the program is that once you get past several lessons they get into real songs and instead of focusing on the guitar playing they have someone singing and its very distracting as a musician of many instruments brassstrings any musician practices again and again the parts they are having difficulty with and the goal is to play your part correctly the singing on a guitar playing tutorial program was very distracting the good parts of this program are that it does explain concepts very well the idea of the slash chord vs power chords are explained well and the exercises reflect the lessons they are teaching in each chapter i feel that this is a great alternative to taking a class filled with other people however im not convinced that its much more effective than a book and a music cd could have been  this program is focused on rockblues and does not touch at all on standard music notation or classical guitar in anyway once a lesson is done there are review screens that go back and quiz you or become reference screens for chords it is very easy to see this book as a sequence and really see how to have a great foundation for guitar playing, emedia guitar for dummies,29.99,0.4411177644710579,,,-411.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,156,32,140,32,311,52,247,52,0.79,0.21,0.21,0.13,1.48,0.86,156,39,39.8,35.9,0.5,0.74,6.26,8.85,0.88,20.74,0.57,0.6,29.28,3.83,0.2,0.56,0.12,0.04,0.16

B000063V0X,4.0,since this is a upgrade version let me talk for experienced flash users  macromedia seems to have taken a few right steps in integrating flash mx with its other products like dreamweaver ultradev and cold fusion server mx acquired from allaire even though cold fusion mx is at a beta  stage right now its easy to see some of the powerful multimedia features being integrated into the macromedia products based on thatsome of the best new changes in flash mx that warrant an upgrade are actionscript the scripting language that powers flash interactivity is now easier to write and analyze flash mx has a fully functional script editor with features similar to those found in its other programs like dreamweaver cold fusion studio and homesite the editor helps both experienced and beginning programmers write valid actionscript by providing codehinting autoformatting and searchandreplace functions flash mx also contains a complete debugger for the first time flash is offering a collection of templates to simplify the production of standard web documents such as ads slide shows and tutorials in addition the templates are smart for example a photo album template includes all the programming necessary for a photo slideshow a lot of ui components like scroll bars check boxes and list boxes that previously had to be laboriously created are now included in flash mx the appropriate behaviors are built into these objects so adding functional interface elements to an application is a simple draganddrop operation one of the biggest changes in flash mx is the integration of video the integrated video support provided by the sorenson spark codec can import standard video formats such as avi mpeg or quicktime and convert them to a streaming format that is displayed natively by the flash mx player the import filter can also resize the video or sync the frame rate to the flash movie when converting a file flash mx also provides a powerful tool to modify vector shapes flashs free transform tool is similar to the free transform tools found in standard illustration programs like freehand and illustrator the program lets you rotate size skew and distort objects a special bounding boxcalled an envelopelets you manipulate an objects shape using control points and tangent handles this kind of makes me wonder what itll do to the already overpriced macromedia freehand software a lot of changes have been made to animation processes to make it more efficient the import filter for fireworks png files now intelligently preserves text and vector shapes which will make life a lot easier headline animations are easier to update because flash now maintains individual characters as editable text rather than as nontext vector shapes some changes have changed the visual appearance of flash mx workspace now you can dock and collapse palettes and you have the ability to define and switch between different palette configurations like developer designer etc to optimize the workspace for design or coding layers can be organized into folders the new properties inspector offers an easy way to change an objects basic attributes quickly the library function has also been improved by allowing sharing of symbols between documents flash automatically tracks the original location of each symbol and autoupdates all instances in all documents if the original is modifiedas i mentioned macromedia seems to be moving towards integrating their other products as a result some powerful new features in flash mx await the development of other products in the mx line macromedia has already announced flash server solutions which will consist of a gateway and a communications server the latter will allow developers to add realtime messaging as well as twoway audio and video to flash applicationsi think upgrading to the new version is not even a question,flash mx upgrade,27.6,0.5240384615384616,,,-561.89,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,250,116,237,114,418,180,368,177,0.88,0.48,0.46,0.35,11.71,2.42,250,39,42.6,43.3,0.6,0.82,8.65,12.23,0.91,30.78,0.64,0.77,55.74,5.28,0.2,0.66,0.12,0.02,0.14

B00AM9YXTS,1.0,sadly windows  is probably more maligned than it ought to be in situations that call for more limited input and minimal multitasking like a tablet or htpc windows  actually works fairly well the issue comes when microsoft basically forced it onto the desktop workspace and the fact is that windows  just isnt a desktop os the start button is gone the desktop that were used to is neutered really what makes windows well windows the native windows  apps are fullscreen affairs and as far as the ui goes it just seems like a major step backward for those who actually work on a pc windows  basically makes you take a hop step and a jump where would cold just turn and step in windows  productivity takes a hit this is why the businesses arent adopting it and thats why windows  is failingit works well enough on tablets and htpcs imho but i had to dock it an extra star because ive had nothing but bad luck with it my htpc was running windows  pro so i opted to use the upgrade there i had to basically erase everything and start fresh with the upgrade but thats frankly how i prefer to do it anyways the upgrade process went smoothly and was less timeconsuming than i would have guessed all but one driver was installed and the os was running well i started to install my apps and standard desktop programs without a hitch so far so good the next day i fired it up to continue downloading some things and play a game on steam only to have the system bluescreen on me that isnt that big a deal in and of itself not my first rodeo with windows osesbluescreens are almost a certainty at some point but the options available to deal with it are vague at best guessing the refresh is akin to the repair install in windows xp while the full reset is a more traditional windows reinstall since it gets rid of whatever you have on the pc the fact that none of them worked is also disappointingso here i am with a nonfunctional pc that had been fine for a couple of years using windows  that in and of itself isnt a condemnation of the windows  os again kind of used to it by this point but the fact that the os itself is so not compelling that im strongly considering going back to  probably is as it now stands i cant really think of a single compelling reason to upgrade to windows  especially on a traditional desktop or nontouchenabled laptop windows  simply wasnt designed with those platforms the vast majority of the pc market mind you inmindupdate ultimately the issue that i was having was due to a bad hard drive so i cant fault windows  for that once i received the replacement from western digital i reinstalled windows  and this time all went well well thats not entirely correcteverything went well until activation it wouldnt workat all i searched and saw that this has been an ongoing issue since windows  was in public beta and it still has not been resolved luckily for me the overly tedious phone activation did work but that shouldnt be necessary and yes my wireless network adaptor and router are working properly it also wouldnt activate over a wired connectionthe pc worked well enough until this morning steam works diablo iii installed without a hitch all of my standard apps as far as compatibility goes its been great i turn on the pc today only to see that it needs to restart due to updates okthats typical microsoft there so i restart nothing the system posts windows  begins to boot and then goes to a black screenthats it apparently this is another ongoing issue and after pressing  to go into the repair process windows tells me that my system is unable to boot properly thanks for the tip it tells me that its going to do a restore and it does my system starts thats all fine and good but im growing a bit weary of hoopjumping its obvious to me that windows  isnt ready for primetime its got all of the typical bugs that typify a microsoft os once those are out of the way and once microsoft repairs the neutered desktop windows  might be something to consider but as things are youd do better to wait unless you really really like the modern metro ui andor halfbaked apps theres no real reason to upgrade to windows update im done microsoft the pc had been running normally until this morning upon booting i notice that i have no connectivity so i go to troubleshoot my wireless connection windows crasheshard the pc restarts and i can tell something is wrong because its taking forever long story short and three hours worth of repair attempts later and ive made my decision to go back to windows  the repairs dont work the new frowny bsods give precious little information no error codes just microsofts condolences and a vague error message telling me that my system configuration information was badyay i just want a computer that works and the only thing i use this pc for is gaming and the occasional movie have it in the living room so far windows  has been a nightmare maybe ill give it

B000EGIMFA,5.0,professor samuel hunt is a researcher at the british museum in   hes looking for something really special that will make his name in his field and one night he finds it in the form of an anonymous letter  the letter contains the page of an old book or codex and warns that unless professor hunt solves its mysteries certain doom will fall upon us all  of course the good professor sets out at once driven less by a sense of heroism than by intellectual curiosityagon  the mysterious codex comprises the first three episodes of a  game originally released for download only the remaining episodes will be available as they are produced first via download and then on cd or dvd  in it you will explore the british museum the icy wilds of lapland and the jungles of madagascar in search of the ancient game of nations the game is mainly first person with some third person cutscenes  there are no timed puzzles and you cant diei was immediately struck by the beauty of agon  the backgrounds are simply incredible as are the animations which often transform a watercolour stillshot into a moving scene  the character animations are a little sketchier but still quite good  while im on game basics most of those were above par as well  voice acting was very good  sounds were subtly integrated into the whole  music was little used but what there was was fine  some written materialletters and journalswere very lovely with intensely picturesque writing although the handwriting fonts used were sometimes hard to decipher and a little fadedthe puzzles in agon are a wide assortment dominated by inventory and decoding messages  one long message in morse code takes patience and a plan  in another place the symbols you needed to decode were very faint and hard to read causing unecessary difficulty  but neither puzzle was impossible and as i enjoy decoding quite a lot i chose not to mark the game down for this  you may think otherwise  there is one sound puzzle that you must repeat over and over again for a particular reason  although this made sense within the context of the game i found it quite irritating and wished that i didnt have to do it after the second or third timeat the end of each chapter you must defeat an opponent in a game of strategya clue to the agon  i was initially a little intimidated by these games but managed to win each after  or  tries  you can also go back and play the games just by themselves after youve won theman entertaining bonusi liked this game quite a lot because of the subject matter and the hero  samuel hunt is an unusual man who is willing to sacrifice himself and take on dangerous tasks not to save the world but in the pursuit of his academic research  however his is the only character you will really come into contact with so if youre looking for a classicstyle adventure this is probably not the game for you  but if you like fist person puzzleheavy games and dont mind waiting for a definite conclusion give agon a try  i think you wont be disappointed,agon ancient games of nations the mysterious codex,8.99,0.5393258426966292,,,-462.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,218,86,200,85,312,102,264,101,0.85,0.38,0.39,0.26,4.2,1.45,218,45,44.4,42.3,0.7,0.84,8.73,12.34,0.94,39.95,0.76,0.85,44.33,4.71,0.2,0.69,0.18,0.06,0.24

B00OMQLNJK,3.0,first off it is important to know that i am a complete amateur when it comes to photo editing or drawing software i know just enough to get by in adobe photoshop and have bumbled around in other painting programs over the years so this is a review coming from someone who isnt skilled or fluent in these types of softwareso what did i thinkfirst of all anyone can easily turn a photo into a painting using the autopainting tool basically you just pick the style of painting you want from  choices including detailed painting impressionist painting and so on and hit the play button and your photo gets turned into a painting automatically i thought some of them like pencil drawing and pen and ink drawing were just awful when i tried it with a photo of my dog i barely got anything showing up you can then touchup the photo as you like using the brushes here is where i started to fall apart as i didnt find the program very intuitive i kept having to refer to the user guide to figure out how to do stuff and even then i wasnt quite doing it right so even though this is supposed to be a more basic program i didnt find it geared to amateurs like myself im attaching some examples to my review so you can see the results i was able to get basically doing nothing im including some examples of what i was able to do with the autopaint feature im sharing the original photo of my dog and then what i got when i used detailed painting impressionist painting watercolor sketch and pen and ink obviously there is a lot more you can do but youve got to learn how to use the program and make it work given time i could probably get more out of this program but given the review deadline i had i didnt get a chance to work with the software as much as i would have likedaside from making your photos into art there are a variety of drawing tools that you can use to paint on photos or just create a painting not being an artist i couldnt really think of anything to create from scratch but i think if you know what youre doing you might find these tools useful i used the desktop computer version and found it difficult to draw with a mouse i think if you used a mobile version for an ipad which i think i saw was available and used a stylus you would have much better results and if you had some artistic skills to begin with i tried to use some of the neat filters that were advertised on the box for example the kaleidescope effect but couldnt get them to load or work at all i followed the instructions in the user guide but felt like i ended up in an endless loop that never workedoverall for an amateur i think most youre not going to be able to do much other than turn your photos into something that looks more arty or painterly whether the price is worth it to do this or you can find other apps or programs out there to do this cheaper and better im not sure this was a bit of a lark for me since it was a vine product i thought i might be able to do more with this than i could but really found the program unfriendly to someone who comes into this totally clueless so for what it is worth that is my review,corel painter essentials  digital art suite for pc and mac old version,36.1,0.40460526315789475,,,-520.27,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,176,62,155,58,362,84,304,78,0.84,0.26,0.35,0.16,2.92,1.21,176,41,37.8,39.6,0.49,0.77,6.54,9.25,0.88,20.9,0.51,0.49,26.27,3.62,0.18,0.53,0.09,0.03,0.12

B0079KJ64A,4.0,i may rate scrivener much higher as i get to know it better  it is rather soon to be asking me what i think of it  anyway i do a broad range of writing but what i enjoyed for the non fiction essay writing is the research section where you can put all the links to the articles and images you used for your work and refer to it as you build your essay  this is often a big issue for me keeping track of my sources  in terms of my fiction work another section i appreciated is the one for character sketches  i enjoyed putting together my descriptions in answers to the template questions  in addition i searched for pictures of the characters online and added those to the character sketches and that really helped me in terms of visualizing my characters  i just completely outlined my most recent book and i found that the outline feature combined with the cork boards helped me to structure my story really effectively  i enjoy the flexibility and the way i can adjust the outline as my ideas change  i like being able to bounce from research to outline to manuscript to notes to character and scene sketches as i progress through my story it makes my writing more  dimensional and more easy to travel through and alter and adjust  when i worked in microsoft word i found it very difficult to rise above a very sequential experience of the work i was doing  i believe that i have only touched upon some of the features of scrivener at this point because i just started using it  for example i know that as i am writing if i have a concern i can write a little side note which i can come back to laterthats great because your writing flow doesnt get interrupted  still have to see how that works  but there is a lot more  then once you are done you can save it into any kind of document you need in order to send it to be made into a kindle document or in a format your publisher would prefer,scrivener  for mac download,45.0,0.5138888888888888,,,-277.01,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,127,27,116,27,207,36,182,36,0.88,0.2,0.21,0.15,1.37,0.83,127,40,40.9,37.9,0.61,0.77,6.24,8.83,0.91,25.28,0.64,0.68,27.12,3.68,0.22,0.64,0.1,0.05,0.15

B00NA6LO8I,3.0,there are both pros and cons with this software i make all of my greeting cards because i enjoy doing it i previously have used nova greeting card factory software hallmark has better designs than nova does although hallmark includes its logo on the back page you can opt not to use that which i prefer since i have my own design to use on the backone of my problems with hallmark is that too many of the cards come in a format that fits on  paper that must be folded into fourths i prefer using card stock and printing cards that are designed for the paper to be folded in half attempts to transfer a design made for two folds to one with only one fold have been less than successful i have learned to click on printing to see what the format is because i cant tell otherwise until i have everything ready to print before i figured out that i must do that i would have cards ready to go  i usually add a personal touch including the recipients name  and then would find out if was the wrong formatif hallmark would team with nova they would have a really great product until then i alternate back and forth depending on my needsmy other problem with hallmark is that it doesnt have rulers on the sides so i can tell if something that i add is centered nova does which makes it easier to use since purchasing hallmark card studio i have located and purchased nova card factory version  i alternate between that and hallmark when making cards if hallmark would make their designs easier to use i would stick with it because the design quality is better,hallmark card studio  deluxe,34.99,0.49828178694158076,,,-206.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,89,23,83,23,182,40,154,38,0.85,0.25,0.26,0.17,1.56,0.88,89,33,35.9,33.9,0.49,0.69,4.66,6.6,0.86,16.44,0.54,0.62,19.69,3.14,0.21,0.5,0.1,0.05,0.15

B00BKWXNDI,4.0,i am a longtime kaspersky customer  although the software works well the company  or its vendor  is suspect as to billing and unrequested automatic reenrollment  unless a user goes online and opts out of automatic reenrollment kaspersky will renew the users contract annually even if it is not requested  this could be a good move in that it maintains protection for customers who do not check their emails carefully for an expiration notice  however i went online and checked the box that removed me from kasperskys automatic reenrollment  i do not want to give anyone automatic access to my credit card  kaspersky sent an email confirming i was now enrolled for manual updating  i did this because i plan to switch to bitdefender  the next day i see that i have been billed for another year even though i still have four days left on my old subscription  alright i could accept this as a lag in the billing process that had already been in the pipe line  however the final insult is that the billing for the update to a longtime user was    this is for a download update  the price from amazon today for kaspersky pure is   perhaps the  difference is the kaspersky penalty for loyal customers  my suggestion  this is generally one of the top two rated protection programs  however if you sign up wait until the kaspersky charge shows up on your account and then change your credit card number  in this day of security hacks it might be a good idea to change your card number anyway,pure    user,59.88,0.5687022900763359,,,-186.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,101,31,92,31,162,45,133,45,0.82,0.34,0.31,0.2,1.2,0.77,101,37,38.9,38.6,0.62,0.76,5.61,7.94,0.91,23.79,0.69,0.83,20.83,3.23,0.19,0.67,0.1,0.05,0.15

0321719816,5.0,ive been creating websites with dreamweaver for years now and all that experience has taught me one thing  im a hack web designer  recently i have been trying to learn industry css standards and had heard that dreamweaver has made great advances in css management in  and  im embarrassed to say what version i am usingwhen i got a chance to get a reviewer copy of this training set i jumped for two reasons first i was mulling over spending the money to upgrade to dw  and i second i have always that i was missing out on a lot of dws capabilities  its now obvious that i should upgrade for the css management upgrades aloneas for the value of the training  i couldnt be happier  this is not an advanced tips and tricks resource nor is it an exhaustive boot camp in web page authoring but it is a fairly thorough training taking you from site planning and design to creation and publishing  i watched the videos from beginning to end and they start pretty basic with an html refresher then move to the meatier dw specific training  i can see myself returning to several sections later to brush uppersonally the css media and forms training videos were enough to justify the price tag  the training lessons were short and easily digestible  i liked that it broke training into  minutes so i had some time to do a little more indepth googling on subjects like text wrapping on absolute positioned css objects which it wont or checking my version of dw  what this is   an adobe certification training aid  so it starts from a very low level introduction and  goes through the entire dw web creation process   a wonderfully designed interface   a great overview of using dwwhat it isnt   a substitute for spending the time working with dw but it will jump start a novice   an expert tips and tricks referenceall in all i highly recommend this to anyone trying to learn dw or even web design in general the css placement section has been the most enlightening coverage of the topic i have been able to find  the authors delivery on the videos is great and the interface is the best most intuitive i have seen the only bad thing i can say is that the closed captioning is defaulted on so at times it covered the bottom of the properties table at the bottom of the screen so sometimes i had to close it to see things the author was pointing out  but all in all this is an absolutely wonderful product,learn adobe dreamweaver  by video core training in web communication,35.23,0.5287356321839081,,,-361.6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,176,62,161,61,279,82,231,81,0.83,0.35,0.35,0.23,3.41,1.31,176,39,40.8,43.0,0.63,0.84,7.45,10.54,0.92,29.89,0.7,0.79,40.97,4.53,0.23,0.63,0.14,0.04,0.18

B00005LBVU,5.0,this is one of the first cdroms that has stumped my rather precocious daughter  she gets frustrated with it and does not spend hours clicking away at it  paradoxically i see this as a very good thing  in most of her other learning software packages there is no penalty for guessing and so she became adept at discovering the pattern needed to move on  they are really nothing but glorified multiple choice exams  simple by clicking on everything  sure she can learn a lot from them but i always saw it as allowing her to cheat as wellin this program if she gets something wrong she loses one of her little guys which eventually disallows her to move forward  so it doesnt pay to guess  she has to think about what is right in a systematic manner to move ahead  she also cannot backtrack and do something over  instead she has to go back to the start of the game with a new set of problemsi am also impressed with the logic portion of this software  the player has to recognise which features from sets and subsets in various contexts  that means systematic and abstract thinking but made fun as a game journey of creatures the player creates at the beginning though my daughter is stumped by some of it now she will really have beaten a challenging puzzle when she gets it perhaps with lasting impact on her reasoning abilities  visually while this is not as snazzy as some other cdroms it is pleasing enoughall in all one of the best learning cdroms i have yet seen  it really challenges my child which is exactly what i was looking forhighly recommended,zoombinis logical journey  pcmac,15.88,0.5780141843971631,,,-197.84,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,118,37,103,35,160,42,128,40,0.8,0.31,0.31,0.25,2.75,1.17,118,47,41.9,45.4,0.74,0.91,6.6,9.33,0.94,36.74,0.8,0.77,26.27,3.62,0.27,0.82,0.16,0.07,0.23

B002DHLUWK,4.0,im happy to say that i am  for the most part  very pleased with this upgrade so far  i came from vista  and i have now officially entered the  era by installing windows    for quite a few months i read about peoples experiences with the betas and release candidates and was excited about the good news i kept hearing  i decided to just be patient and put in for my preorder like most people did which meant waiting for the october  release datelets go through this topic by topicinstallation it was easy almost too easy  for some reason i was half expecting to wait more than an hour to get this on my machine but instead i was up and running in roughly  minutes or so i performed a clean install not an upgrade  and on top of that all of my primary devices were recognized see the end of my review for complete system specs  the windows easy transfer utility was an enormous help in getting my user identity and files into my new configurationuser interface personally i thought vista was very handsome what with its transparency  effects color schemes and usability improvements to windows explorer and i believe windows  continues that trend by looking just as sexy  if not more  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements  it just seems like a great deal of effort was put forth into making everything slick polished and logically consistent and ive already fallen in love with many of the additional improvements such as the revamped and more versatile taskbar jump lists and customizable themes  i havent yet become accustomed to some features like aero shake but hey those things are there if i need them  but the clean keep it simple approach the attention to detail and even minimalism in certain areas is certainly appreciated  and sure some people might scoff at the shiny facade and dismiss certain parts of it as being bells and whistles but honestly isnt it actually useful to have the ability to see fullscreen previews of running applications or to be able to hide all of your open windows and take a quick glance at whats underneath  all of these niceties simply add up to a more functional and usable desktopperformance i think its actually better than vista  overall the system feels more responsive and well snappier especially with regards to video performance  gaming is as smooth as could be  no complaints as far as startup shutdown and resuming from sleep mode are concernedstability very good but ill give  an a here  i got just one blue screen of death so far and that was during the installation of a particular piece of software i forget what it was to be honest  maybe a browser plugin  other than that its been rocksolid with absolutely no crashes  ive even gone through some software development debugging sessions in which the program i was working on was repeatedly throwing up on me and windows  recovered gracefully every timesoftware compatibility pretty high marks but not perfect  i think some of it has to do with my transition to  anyways like the fact that im having trouble with a specific component in visual basic  i use it to support a piece of software i designed for work  no big deal though  im going to circumvent it by using my copy of windows xp in suns virtualbox to run it so problem solved  another issue i had was the fact that the installation of samsung media studio  for my  player causes windows media player to fail to launch when i try to open a media file but again thats not a showstopper because i can manipulate that device directly in the os anyways without that application  and dont laugh but it looks like i might have to give up publisher   heh heh  yeah ive been using that program for years now to do miscellaneous desktop publishing but guess what  its installer is   so again thats a  lack of support for  issue not really a problem with windows  per se  plus i guess i could still run it in my virtual xp machine if i wanted to  other than those snags i just mentioned the majority of my applications and games run just fine  and thank goodness cakewalk music creator still works with my midi and audio interface deviceswindows live essentials i guess it was a smart move on behalf of ms  a little less bloat for people who would rather choose alternatives to those programs but still available as a free download  personally i feel that microsoft has been blessed with a lot of talented people who are really experts at design  the basic necessities such as live mail and calendar and all of the other apps are wonderful in my opinionothing things i like the devices section in the control panel is now much better and ejecting usb devices is quicker and easier  user switching works flawlessly  im a big fan of the ribbon which is the new user interface mechanism and visual style that is incorporated into the builtin tools such as paint and wordpad  i find it to be very fresh and innovative  im looking forward to upgrading from office xp to office   even calculator is betterbugs or quirks the link for opening the backup applet is broken but not when it is launched via the new action center  also unlike in vista mozilla firefox seems to have developed this strange problem of occasionally reporting that it cant find the server when i try to connect to certain websites that are listed in the results of a google search  but when i click the browsers back button the site will then appear and usually sites load properly when they are opened via the bookmarks menu or through other search engines  internet explorer  doesnt exhibit this behavior at all and the problem has started to bother me so much that i finally decided to install google chrome as my default browser i tried resetting my router and it didnt seem to have any effectin summary i think microsoft did the right thing by listening to its users and trying to correct vistas shortcomings whether real or just perceived  i cant say this is a revolution its more like evolution boy how many times has that been said about a software product  but to me its a step in the right direction and if things stay the course windows could have a bright

B000VLZCEW,3.0,i have been a ghost user for a long time  it has always worked well for me  i recently lost the ghost disk after a move so i needed to get another imaging software  i decided to give true image a try  i downloaded the trial versionmy first attempt was to simply backup a hard drive and then restore to a larger new drive  simple enough  with ghost all you did was back it up and then restore to the new drive  the new drive was then expanded to the new sizeno so with true image  when i did the same backup and restore procedure i got the same partition size on the new drive and the the rest of the drive was unavailable  unless i wanted to create another partition which i didntafter spending a lot of time with their documentation  which i thought was very confusing i found out that i needed to delete the existing partition on the new drive and then need to use another utility option within the program  i then came to an option within that utility that asked me if i wanted it done automatically or manually  at first i chose manual and that would not work  i then tried automatic and it did what i wanted  i guess they intended the image to be an exact clone but that doesnt make any sense when upgrading to another hard drive  the other utility worked but the documentation was terribleacronis really needs to update their manual and make their menu system more intuitive to use  i find ghost much better in this regardoverall the product worked for me but i keep wondering if i would better off with ghost again due to the poor documentation it took me more than twice as long to get the same thing done as in an earlier version of ghost,acronis true image  home old version,22.17,0.4775641025641026,,,-228.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,105,30,94,29,196,45,172,44,0.88,0.26,0.29,0.17,1.5,0.87,105,40,38.0,34.6,0.54,0.73,5.3,7.5,0.88,19.38,0.55,0.63,21.41,3.27,0.2,0.5,0.13,0.05,0.17

B00F8K9MZQ,3.0,turbotax clearly seems to be adopting a design philosophy of limiting the users ability to override values on the return  in the past a user could override any calculated or transferred value anywhere on the return  in the   and  versions however that ability has become restricted  so far as i know limitations on overrides only appear in form  passive activities and its worksheets  in  and  i had to prepare form  and its worksheets with a typewriter  i will have to do the same in   fortunately the calculated values from form  flow to other forms and schedules where i could override and compensate for what turbotax has done  but if this design philosophy of no overrides begins to affect infect other parts of the program i will have to abandon it entirelysophisticated users be careful  turbotax is heading in a bad direction,turbotax deluxe fed  efile  state  old version,202.08,0.6028368794326241,141.0,11.75,-80.11,141,1,21,12,1,8,1,5,14,141.0,141.0,11.75,12.0,21.0,12.0,0.6667,8.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,0.4167,14.0,1.1667,53,16,48,15,84,25,73,24,0.87,0.33,0.3,0.24,1.19,0.77,53,38,36.2,34.6,0.63,0.76,4.09,5.78,0.9,18.51,0.66,0.86,15.43,2.78,0.25,0.56,0.1,0.05,0.15

B01617VQJ4,5.0,weve been using turbotax for about  or  years previously we did our taxes ourselves on paper we are a oneincome family who own our home and have young adult children in college  the first year it found a tax credit for college tuition i didnt know i could claim which was a happy surprise turbotax walks us through the steps of inputting our  interest and dividend statements i dont like to use other programs to input our information but it also offers to look for them online and autofill the info the schedule a for our itemized deductions is also easy to do after the first time of figuring out how it all works we donate to a number of organizations and it allows us to enter a list and the amounts of the contribution or value of goods which it prints for our records at the end it walks us through the process of entering our kids tuition statements then recommends possible deductions or credits then allows us to decide which will benefit our family most this yearthe biggest annoyance this year was that i couldnt get the search bar to work at all every time i searched a form it would stall out and never return the result it has worked in past years one of our kids graduated from college this year and i ended up having to download a  from the irs website to change our withholding allowances because turbotax wouldnt load it for me or show it to me not helpfulour son is an actor who gets  statements as well as smaller paycheck amounts that he has to claim as his own small business turbotax allows him to enter his  paychecks and he can also claim his  income expenses and mileage used pursuing auditions and acting jobs as a small business on a schedule c this was very helpful although we spent half an hour online trying to figure out the difference between business and commuting on the mileage screen they need to be better defined in turbotax fyi if you have a similar situation business expenses like headshots resumes and training go at the end of schedule c in other expenses not on schedule a under job expenses this issue also took a lot of research to figure outturbotax is generally easy to use and if you hit a snag you can click into the online help which is sometimes instantly helpful and other times not helpful and you have to pursue answers elsewhere when im finished filing our tax returns i copy everything that we used doing our taxes and burn it onto a data cd and make a print copy then delete it all from the computer the paper and cd copies go into a manila envelope labeled for the year when i start the next years tax return i load last years files from the cd then start turbotax its convenient that turbotax can look on your computer for past tax returns and automatically sets up your return for minimal busyworkthis year my taxes only took me a few hours to do including printing checking and filing i like the program and will continue to use it rather than paying someone else to do them which is costly or wading through the paper and math myself which is cheaper but a lot more work,intuit turbotax premier  federal  state taxes  fed efile tax preparation software  pcmacdisc old version,34.96,0.47957371225577267,,,-483.06,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,183,58,168,56,325,81,286,79,0.88,0.28,0.32,0.21,4.01,1.42,183,41,41.9,41.5,0.56,0.82,7.18,10.15,0.9,25.3,0.59,0.7,44.1,4.7,0.22,0.58,0.08,0.02,0.11

B00005TQ1G,4.0,this program is pretty inexpensive and no its not going to teach you to speak french fluently  im not good with languages but ive found that making a run at french has required years lots of reading different books spending time with movies streaming audio over the internet and all sorts of things  this oneprogram isnt going to turn you into a fluent french speaker no single book piece of software or class willi didnt get much use out of most of the functionality in this product  but i do like the speech recognition very much  the program has a meter that gives you an idea of how well youre pronouncing words  its hard to get it pegged into the green at least for me but when i do i believe that im pronouncing the words pretty well  in fact i took a level  class at alliance francaise here in chicago and was as good as anyone at pronunciation and was complimented by my teacher despite being behind the rest on most other aspects of the language  this was entirely due to working with the speech recognition feature in an earlier version of this producti think its particularly helpful in light of the fact that language labs seem to be out of favor  at least they didnt use them at the alliance francaise  there arent many sources of help available for learning correct pronunciationif youre expecting this package to teach you french all by itself youre going to be disappointed  but if youre serious about learning how to pronounce things this is a great tool and for the money i think its a fantastic dealif anyone from the learning company reads this id like to suggest that they bring out a new product focusing completely on pronunciation and vocabularly  if they had a product with maybe  words and solid tools for learning the subset of the vocabulary you needed id pay a couple of hundred bucks for it at least,learn to speak french ,29.98,0.5333333333333333,,,-255.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,131,40,123,39,192,51,171,47,0.89,0.27,0.31,0.18,1.45,0.85,131,45,43.8,43.9,0.68,0.87,6.69,9.45,0.93,31.4,0.72,0.73,23.27,3.41,0.19,0.76,0.18,0.04,0.22

B01F7RJHIQ,4.0,my personal favorite versions of microsoft office are   and  in my opinion  stinks but thats another story office  was in my opinion the first modern version of office and i still cry a tear for my friend clippy office  was the first version of office i would call truly solid with an amazing help system that i used as a helpdesk tech to solve many a problem freebusy errors anyone and office  after the cruel joke that was office  its a breath of fresh air to say the leastperhaps the biggest change in office  is the new tabs to put is bluntly tabs replace just about everything in the new office and pretty much any feature you want to use is part of a tabbed menu toolbar or window depending on your definitions another way to think of all these tabs is as massive sticky menus that can be slim as a toolbar or take up the entire screen it became very obvious to me very quickly that these tabs were heavily thoughtthrough by microsoft during development i like them a loti also like the overall smoothness of how office operates now the enormous reduction in crashes and bugs i have seen over office  and the overall feel and user experience i had actually been using abiword to type up amazon reviews and stories due to the way it draws letters and words but after using office  i can actually say that not only is it a pleasure to use but it is so workable and easy on the eyes that i want to use it for general writing something i thought i would never say in fact i liked it so much that i actually paid to get a home copythere are only two things i do not like in the new office compared to my other two favorite versions of office the help is terrible the incredibly helpful office assistants were great for learning faster and easier ways to do things but i have yet to find anything similar built into the new office likewise the search function of office  that returned incredibly relevant results now returns totally useless results most of the time for instance mail merge should definitely turn up instructions no matter how obvious the process is if you go through all the different tabs in the main screen toolbarthe other thing i do not like ismicrosoft support i purchased a copy of office  with a free upgrade to office  when i tried to do the upgrade the website refused to allow me to download it stating i had an invalid product id i ended up talking with at least  different microsoft support numbers as well as their online help and contacting amazoncom to boot and the process took weeks of calls in the end one of their semienglishcapable staff of which there appears to be about  people out of thousands finally figured out the source of the problem if you install a previous version of office and install a new version afterwards the product key displayed will be the old one instead of the new one and you will have to call microsoft and have them tell you what your product id is in order to upgrade i shudder to think what i would have done if the key had been bad with every single microsoft representative i spoke to refusing to send me either a copy of office  or a new key i can only conclude that the company does not value their home users in the slightest and would gladly take your money and then refuse to give the product advertised theres a word for this its called stealing i have been told in the past by admin in companies that i work for that the sole reason they continue to use microsoft products is for support if they treat their corporate customers half as bad as their home users thats a flimsy reason to support microsoftin the end i love this product though i have no doubt it will take me years to relearn how everything work that said i intend it to be the last copy of office i ever buy and since i have three copies of office  and two copies of  and each has three licenses it would be kind of insane to upgrade again unless it was free i highly recommend this product if you arent doing anything fancy or if you like me are a technical professional looking to keep up just forget about getting any good support either from inside the program or outside of it,microsoft office home and student  family pack  disc version,259.99,0.4461738002594034,,,-694.18,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,250,75,232,71,463,93,395,88,0.85,0.22,0.3,0.13,1.67,0.91,250,35,41.3,40.3,0.54,0.79,8.22,11.62,0.9,26.55,0.59,0.66,44.45,4.71,0.17,0.53,0.14,0.04,0.18
B000HCZ9AC,5.0,this is an upgrade editionwe should cover a few things about the editions before we review vista starter is very basic and limited to  of memory almost everything good about vista is omitted home basic does not have the aero graphics flip windows special effects home premium has limited networking interaction vista business has the extended networking interaction vista enterprise has unix and virtual machine support ultimate has all the bells and whistles carefully choose what you want before you make this expensive purchaseinstalling vista is very easy checking with hardware vendors for patches and updates is a must windows vista upgrade advisor will identify the changes needed many notebook manufacturers will recommend an updates preinstall patch before a vista upgrade a vista upgrade will identify software on the system that might not be compatible depending on compatibility issues with an upgrade a clean install is also optional and works on notebooks although driver installations must be done after the install sequence is a matter of a few clicks and vista is up and running this might not be so simple if vista is loaded on a virtualization platform like vmware which requires additional configurations of the bios and some other tweaks we have come a long way since the days of windows  insert disc  the first thing that strikes the user is the sheer speed at which vista launches this is most certainly microsofts fastest os to date as soon as vista loads up low and behold the gadgets display appears on the desktop with moving pictures cpu meter realtime news feeds realtime weather clock notes stock exchange calendar and contacts wow impressive stuff but lets stop the press for a moment and tell it like it is gadgets is just apple osxs widgets rippedoff some might say that widgets existed before as separate plugins from yahoo called konfabulator but we are talking about this being inherently part of the os not plugins it is an apple invention that is in demand much like the need for a desktop recycle bin  which apple didnt patent doh microsoft settles for just straight out burglary of apples innovation and hopes that the user just enjoys it truthbetold in modern times when everyone is downloading everyone elses stuff for free microsoft are even in on the game and making money of it however this is all about competition since the competition exists and we may have some things to say about ms and monopoly we should be thankful that other forces are driving ms to do what it may not have done without these pressures  who really cares if vista is ultimately an apple osx rip this is what microsoft has always been about at the same time apple has openly accepted a command line interface ms rightclick save as or open as and intel chips balance things out if you dont like microsoft then you know where to go third party software will probably sway you one way or another however seeing  boot on vmware on top of vista is something that makes you stop and think linux users simply front customization as the bonus to not going with windows and in many ways they have a big point to make vista has the same lockdown start menu system you just cant change it or put any folder anywhere you want in a way this creates a standard where does johnny keep his documents on this system oh yeah the documents folder while at the same time professional users just want to custom the start menu the way they like it but cant microsoft hasnt really got a whole pile of originality going on here although there are many gizmos included and bundled in the ultimate pack and for all intents and purposes vista is osxvista is great its fast fast fast on a  pentium  or  core duo  of ram will run it no problem the first thing to do is to open a pile of windows hold down the windows start key  tab press tab repeatedly and watch as the screen turns into a flip  windows the new aero system also you can get a thumbnail preview of each running window on the task bar by rolling the mouse over it that is very impressive no longer are we pinned down to one desktop just scrolling through multiple windows in  is a sight to behold and in the eyes of many will make the upgrade worth every penny vista also looks a whole world better than xp and is no longer plagued with a boring sterile look vista is art but then again the gadgets play an enormous role in this apart from that windows now has a beautiful fade in and fade out of the windows some of which are transparent so you can see windows underneath this is a whole new art dimension that windows has never presented before and in many ways thankfully somebody decided to higher a graphic designer with all that money they make installing office  just brings it all to life but that is another story of xp software will run on vista the only problem comes with software that creates virtual drives and devices it seems vista security although vista has been cracked already is trying to prevent people from loading up an iso on software like daemon tools no doubt however someone out there will punch a hole through that one  worth of software running on xp here has installed no problem on vista and no bsod blue screens of death or serious flaw seems apparent while some software did not like the way it was installed using windows own manual driver installation just overcame those issues for something so brand new it is hard to fault how stable this isxp users will complain that they have only just learned xp and see no reason why they need vista right now nobody needs vista however microsoft has indicated that some games especially xbox ports like halo  and software will only be vista compatible if you like oss and like what is cutting edge then dont hold back a moment longer and get it if you need a system that is absolutely solid then try out vista and test on another system for a few weeks to see you might be inclined to wait for vista  but to be honest i see no reason why most people can not use this right out of box right now like i said i have ported my xp software over and vista is just as stable surprise well not really since  microsoft got their stability issues sorted out and apple seems just as exploitable these days and anybody who does the reading can see that it is the very existence of  proves this vista gives you a little future boost too and that is probably the main reason to want it this is going to be the future of windows oss for the next few years the last time windows released an os was around the time of  it has been  years the longest gap between microsoft oss in history and it is worth the wait especially imagining what vista  will deliver on many of us are still hoping for a lot of big things to change though why are we still using keyboards and why do we have to interface with our hardware this way bring on the multiuser touchscreen pc and give us a real show dont you think we all deserve it we dothe bottom line here is that this is stable futuretech if that makes your eyes go bing then dont hold back a second more and just get this thing you will be very pleased at experiencing the rush of a new os once again,microsoft windows vista home basic upgrade dvd old

B00G72L9SW,5.0,since the other review for this is so horrible im going to go ahead and write one even though ive only used this simulator for about  weeks ill update as i learn morefirst off let me say that i am an electrician and also a student of industrial process control so if you are anything along those lines from apprentice to engineer than this is going to be a good purchase for you if you are not familiar with the function of ladder logic and the associated items that work with it then this is a good way to figure it outthis product comes with programs for both function block and ladder logic i am not at all familiar with function block right now so i wont comment on that portionyou will need to understand the functions of the icons before beginning and they are all in the instruction manual that is included on the cd the instruction manual is pretty decent and it does a good job of explaining what icons are what but you will have to take the time to read it carefully so that when you get into the simulator you are not confused by all the icons and how to address themthis is a great setup for learning the basics but if you want to get to the programmer level then i would suggest taking a plc class along with this to learn some of the more common programs like rslogix siemens and omron  for my purposes which is simply to learn the basics of plc programming the simulator is an excellent choice for only  dollarsif you do decide to buy this simulator and it works out for you or doesnt for that matter please leave a real review and dont be one of those knuckleheads that only writes about how fast it got to you and the condition of the package were all trying to learn something here and that doesnt do any good for anyone,plc iii virtual plc programming and simulator software ladder and logic function easy automation,2.54,0.5150602409638554,,,-248.59,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,113,31,101,30,178,41,143,40,0.8,0.28,0.27,0.11,0.57,0.53,113,41,40.4,39.1,0.63,0.78,5.99,8.47,0.91,25.66,0.71,0.7,21.84,3.3,0.22,0.74,0.13,0.04,0.17

B005HTIWJ0,5.0,years ago i used to edit video professionally using avid mediacomposer and after effects  i also had some experience with final cut pro near the end of that work  i then moved on to other things professionally and have not had the need to do any serious editing since then  i recently decided to cut my own home videos and needed to buy an editing solution  i looked for an avid solution since that is what i was experienced with but the company was essentially gone knocked off by apples final cut pro largely and while the software is still available it was very expensive and long in the tooth  final cut seemed the obvious solution but it is going a new direction as well and professional editors are vocally disappointed with it these days late  early   so i looked around at the consumer programs not expecting to find anything worthwhile  i was surprised by the available feature in videostudio pro ultimate and decided that for  i wouldnt lose too much my old avid rig cost near  just for the software  my expectations were still low but when the software arrived i was delighted to find out that it worked very well  i still havent had a crash   system  shocking  of course there are things that i could do on avid and final cut that cant be done on this software at least i havent found a way but that isnt surprising  it can do a lot and it works well even for longform videos  it doesnt bog down and it is pretty fast  the integration with dvdblue ray mastering is surprisingly niceas others have said the software is very intuitive  i was used to a keyboardbased editor which is fabulous when you are on deadline  a rapid way to work  but it has a really steep learning curve  the corel system is very visual and easy to understandevery time i use the system i am again surprised by the priceperformance  a great bargain,corel videostudio pro  ultimate old version,32.99,0.5389221556886228,,,-259.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,127,43,117,43,222,52,184,52,0.83,0.28,0.34,0.17,1.36,0.83,127,35,38.7,39.5,0.57,0.77,6.03,8.52,0.9,22.7,0.64,0.64,19.15,3.09,0.16,0.66,0.17,0.1,0.27

B006GOFW3E,3.0,i did not buy this on amazon but i should have and so should you you wont beat the amazon price and the guarantee is especially valuable for a product like thisthe big picture is this is a basic video capture and transfer product  it does one thing with almost no frills and if you have enough computer horsepower and good videos to start with it will probably do that wellnote that it will work with any source of us tv ntsc video  not just vhs im using it to transfer some sony betamax tapes to disk and dvdim using a dell inspiron   memory intel core   processors win xp thats plenty but not overkillthe strong points are simple to use if it works its close to plug and play  the quality of the transferred video is to my eye anyhow every bit as good as the best of the betamax tapes that it came from  i wonder if those who had quality problems had enough computer power  or maybe software bugs have been fixedweak points  based on other comments here dont count on useful customer support  that matters even more because the manual is a joke and the expert advice on the roxio forum ran to trashing people for asking stupid questions  furthermore the way the software looks to the user is not just like most windows products and the feedback what your software is doing now  is lousy  it may be working or it may not youll probably find out eventually but its not going to tell youit crashes win xp  updated to yesterday once in a while including a couple of times since installation of the march  update from roxio  before that but not since it gave me the only hard freeze power off to get out ive ever had on this machine  windows is like that but there are very very few modern software packages that cause such troubles for xphowever the function and user interface are simple enough that you can blunder your way through  if youre comfortable trying that and you start promptly when you get the package so you have the full warranty period to see if it works for you this is probably a good bet for the i want to put my tapes on hddvd jobyou may not want to toss your tapes after transferring them  videotapes that get good care are now thought to last longer than dvds and even hard disks that are in continual use  one of my best tapes was recorded in september  my hds last about  years and some cds i bought  years ago are cracked and unusable  for truly priceless items make more than one copy and keep the tapes toofor older tapes and video recorders your first focus should be on getting the best possible out of them because no software or hardware is going to fix input problems  for older tapes probably youll want to at least fast forward and then rewind before starting  cleaning of recorder heads  if but only if you know how  is probably a good idea maybe even a professional tune up on your machine  but tape path adjustments may mean that tapes you made on that machine when it was a bit off will no longer play well if it aint broke you might not want to fix itlooking for a player for your files  check out gom player  free download excellent tons of function  like adjusting colors on playback  watch out for it to want to install other software when you download  you can say noshame on you corel for dirtying your hands like this  this product needs a new and professionally done looks like other windows products interface it needs a good manual and maybe even online help it needs a forum moderated by people who want to help rather than score points  get rid of the crashes  except for easy  i go a year at a time without one  then you might be able to use easy  as a leader to more advanced products  right now i wouldnt buy a  from you without a tape measure and straightedge a strong seller warranty and the time to check it out thoroughly and promptlyedit the following day  after doing enough to determine that the odds of finishing a  hr conversion is about  i spend a couple more hours looking for roxio help  the forums mention problems like mine crashes on win xp several times but none of those people got useful help  just lists of things that seem morally correct i have installed the latest driver and there isnt any newer update to the package  the comments here about calls to live customer support are all i need to hear about thati think easy vhs to dvd is fatally flawed on win xp it probably has just one serious bug but that one has been there for over five years and theres no sign of a fix  i have ordered a diamond vc  converter i will try it out and continue the review thereeasy vhs  would be perfect for me if it worked on my xp computer  it doesnt  your mileage might be much betteri believe there is no worksforeveryone videotodvdfile product at this time  video conversion is seriously highpower computer use because the job is so hard any software bug is likely to be exposed only more recent computers are up to it anyway and then only if theyre performing welljust how hard the conversion job is depends on details and what you want experts are going to have an advantage getting it right  experts however probably already have put together a high end computer system with capture hardware and various conversionediting software packages thats partly how they got to be experts and they spent  times as much time and money as  of us wouldanyone who  like me  needs something pretty simple should be ready to try more than one less expensive package solution  i think most of us can find something that will do the job well but that may not be the first thing we try  data point i was unable to find any conversion package with better than a four stars rating and every package had a substantial number of one star reviews do some what do i need homework learn as much about video conversion on a computer as you feel is worthwhile read reviews and then before buying make sure youre comfortable with your sellers return policyif you just have

B005IIUFYU,4.0,i had used print master deluxe  for many years but had to purchase a newer edition when i purchased a new desktop with windows   i looked at the ratings of the various editions of print master on amazoncom and found that print master  had the highest rating of any of the versions that could be loaded using windows   it also appeared that print master  should be able to open my old files where other newer versions would not do so  print master  with a rating of  stars appeared to be a better choice then print master  with a rating of only  stars which could not open my old filesprint master  loaded easily and it was able to open my old files  the only problem with some of the old files when opened was that not all of the graphics in my certificates could be downloaded including the border around the edge of the certificates  i believe that occurred because some of the graphics were not in the same location on my new desktop as on the old desktop and the border i was using was not available in the border library on print master   i did not like any of the possible borders in print master  so i went to the google images found a border i liked downloaded the border graphic to paint shop pro made the necessary refinements and saved the file  i had to do a few other operations before i actually had my certificates with the new border but they were very easy to do with print master i had several banners and almost all of the graphics downloaded ok for them  where the graphics did not download it was easy to replace them from their location on my new desktop with print master in general print master  is easy to use and operates much like my old version of print master deluxe   my main compliant is that the help information provided in print master  was useless in help me to creating a new border for my certificates  i probably played around for about an hour or more before i finally determined how to create certificates with a new border that i likedbeside the other positive comments i mentioned above you cannot beat the price of  that i paid on amazoncom for print master  and the software was delivered much sooner then estimated by the shipper  i gave print master  a  star rating mainly because the help information was virtually useless in helping me to deal with the missing border problem on my certificates,broderbund printmaster ,1.96,0.3901869158878505,,,-354.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,107,20,96,19,260,58,221,57,0.85,0.26,0.19,0.05,0.15,0.28,107,31,35.3,32.9,0.41,0.66,4.69,6.64,0.84,15.13,0.43,0.64,24.47,3.5,0.17,0.32,0.1,0.03,0.13

B0014X2UAK,4.0,i already have microsoft office  for mac but wanted some of the features that are in the mac preferred office software mainly keynote  this was a cheap way of getting all three of the office products that work really well on my machine  the software installs quickly and if you are using the disk does not require a product key or serial number  after installing software updates updated it to  the last version before the switch to the  version  what is currently in the app store  the software works fine i am using mountain lion i have not tried it in maverick but i am pretty sure it will not have an issue  this is because maverick did not work properly with some of my hardware so i downgraded back to   iwork as a software is great since it quickly launches and never freezes up like ms office does  however it is a much different interface and will take some time to get use to  i also do not like that you cannot default to save as a ms document you can only export to those formats  however you can open and edit them all without any issuesa feature i use frequently that is not available is equation editor however ms office has it so i use it in word  numbers and pages work really well and offer a full feature of productivity software you expect with a mac feel to it so get ready to rely heavily on the file menu vs the bar and banner like in office  keynote is the main winner here it offers some really nice features and transitions that make presentations easy  however transitions are not as great as office  but for mac options they are the best choicein the end this software is great and easy to use i think if you are a real power user you will probably want both ms office and iwork but for most users iwork will have that mac feel and work really well  i got this online since it was much cheaper than buying through the app store not the newest version after the  update it is close but i do not see too many features that would constitute the app store pricei want to add that i purchased an new copy from a third party seller and i received just a disk in a sleeve  the disk was a legit apple disk not a burn or anything but it was not in a box  this does not seem to matter since the disk worked perfectly but i wanted to let you know since based on the item i expected a inbox retail version software product i bought it new,iwork ,27.41,0.4581497797356828,,,-372.42,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,145,42,130,41,284,60,226,59,0.8,0.26,0.29,0.16,1.64,0.91,145,39,37.7,38.5,0.51,0.79,6.08,8.6,0.88,20.62,0.58,0.64,24.93,3.53,0.17,0.55,0.12,0.05,0.18

B004CRNACW,5.0,i have a general working knowledge of several languages  studied in high school and college and through living and working in various countries  but have never formally studied french and knew very little of it ive been looking for years for a suitable program for it but have always shied away from the total immersion approach of rosetta stone from my albeit limited exposure to rosetta it seems that their lessons leave too many unsolved questions about whats going on to follow them youd really need to equip yourself with a grammar book and dictionary and be prepared to dig for lots of explanations the lessons dont supplythe theory behind an immersion program seems to be that little children learn languages much better than adults so we should try to mimic that experience with adults the trouble is that adults dont learn as little children do  and as the fluenz creators recognize thats both a plus and a minus its a disadvantage in that adults will most likely never master a language quite as deeply as a child an englishspeaking adult who learns french for examplewill never be able to speak french without at least a trace of an english accent but having learned english thoroughly before learning french is also a huge advantage english speaking adults can leverage their existing knowledge of how a language english works to learn the target language as adult english speakers we already understand the many forms we need a verb to take for i you she we they so when we learn the i form we look for the he form and etc because of the knowledge we have of what we dont know we make much more rapid progress in the target language than a child couldbut we can do so only if we are given explanations that correspond to the questions we naturally have for a simple example we naturally wonder why do you say you are going en france but a paris its unnecessarily frustrating if the language program you use never bothers to provide you with the simple explanation that you always use a when you are going to a city but not necessarily to a countryeach fluenz lesson begins with a short intro then goes to a dialogue which provides information and vocabulary relevant to tourists each lesson develops and expands upon the grammar introduced in the previous lessons because most people traveling to francophone countries will be interested in getting the basics down lessons often center on being in a cafe and ordering food or with traveling from place to place or asking questions at a hotel these short dialogues can be listened to with no subtitles with subtitles only in french and with subtitles in english and french after the student has listened to the dialogue the instructor comes on and goes through what the student has just heard line by line adding additional relevant information as well as mnemonic devices to help students retain the information the instructor also adds related concepts or structures to those introduced in the dialogue subsequent workouts encourage students to practice through reading writing listening and speaking what i find particularly delightful are the little comments the instructor sprinkles in along the way about some element from film or sports or culture once the instructor mentioned that the bidet was one of frances great gifts to womankind i doubt ill ever forget that line as it was so unexpected and human a remarkas much as i love this program i would have given it  stars rather than  if that were possible because the software is just a bit glitchy you have to play around with it in order to get it to work properly for example you might in a given workout get just one question and find when you hit next that the workout seems to be done there is no way to move forward within it what you need to do in that case is select next workout and then go back  and backwards  until you complete the previous workout it took a while for me to realize this so i missed some valuable practice along the wayoverall fluenz is an excellent program long overdue i look forward to learning my next language with fluenz,fluenz french  for mac pc iphone ipad amp android phones version ,378.0,0.4616457461645746,,,-647.83,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,235,73,217,73,418,99,358,98,0.86,0.27,0.31,0.15,2.42,1.1,235,45,44.1,39.8,0.56,0.81,8.13,11.49,0.9,27.47,0.61,0.62,41.09,4.53,0.18,0.59,0.13,0.05,0.18

1565855825,1.0,these lectures were designed to pick apart and discredit the bible  ehrman lost me on the  lesson in order to make his points ehrman deliberately chooses to ignore various aspects such as what we know to be the spiritual world and idioms and customs of the day  he wants a person to believe that the gospels were being written by men who may not have very good memories in their old age instead of by men who walked and talked with jesus for  years and later documented his life and teaching by inspiration from god which for them became very real on the day of pentecost  if you ignore the spiritual world you have ignored everything about this world and the essence of the bible  he gives another scenario where the gospels were written down by storytellers who had heard stories for people who had heard them from people who had heard them from people who had heard them etc and were therefore embellished and inaccurateehrman claims a contradiction where the gospel of mark says that jesus was crucified on passover while john says he was crucified on the day of preparation of the passover  to make his point ehrman ignores the fact that it was common to blend the slaying of the passover the passover feast and the feast of the unleavened bread and to look upon all three as one great festival and to use the names passover and unleavened bread interchangeably to describe the entire eight days  you can find this in the writings of the historian josephusehrman asks what is joseph  marys home town  he says if you read luke it is nazareth but if you read matthew it is bethlehem  well joseph was on the tax rolls in bethlehem the place of his birth but was living in nazareth  would this be a reason to discredit luke or matthewif you are spiritually motivated to learn more about the bible this course it not for you,the new testament,10.41,0.5060606060606061,,,-246.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,114,46,105,43,177,68,144,62,0.81,0.43,0.4,0.17,1.39,0.83,114,45,42.1,38.1,0.64,0.79,6.06,8.57,0.92,26.45,0.73,0.72,23.67,3.44,0.23,0.75,0.11,0.03,0.15

B0016ZOUUO,4.0,update   fluenz just released  charging purchasers of  a  upgrade fee  i am happy to report that  cures most of the problems i first noted in my review  the dvd can be installed to your hard drive and thus is usable on netbooks and other portable devices  it now remembers where you left off so you can pick up there again without any wasted effort  the program can be minimized though still only displayed on the default monitor as far as i can tell  the license is the most flexible of any program you will buy and i can use it on my laptop and netbook  all in all a worthy upgrade that leaves some nits for  but takes care of the most pressing issues  as noted in my earlier review the method is proving to be very good upgraded from  to original review  the method makes sense and seems to be quite good  the software program itself however is laughable for this day and age  the company surely must be planning a real version and they should certainly give a complementary upgrade to those of us who bought this beta version  from many examples    there are on real instructions on how to use the software  the software does not allow you to view it on any screen except your default screen so if you have multiple monitors or use a laptop with a larger monitor that for many reasons you dont want to make your default you cannot do what every other dvd or program allows you to do  worse the program window cannot ever be minimized so you can work on other tasks while you take a break or even email  to take a break you have to exit the program  and unlike a normal dvd the program does not remember where you were so you have start from scratch by rebooting the dvd finding your lesson and then spend  minutes finding your place in that lesson  that is every time you want to take a break  the program cannot be loaded in any form onto the computer so you cannot use this on netbooks or mobile notebooks without a dvd player actually running  thus to use it your dvd must be running which will kill your battery if you are using this on a plane or away from a plug  you cannot navigate backwardsforwards between items within a lesson workout rather you can only navigate between workouts     in sum if you are used to modern computer software and basic functionality you will be sorely dissapointed  star,learn french fluenz french  for mac pc iphone ipad amp android phones version ,258.0,0.48130841121495327,,,-354.49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,145,44,130,44,241,62,195,62,0.81,0.32,0.3,0.17,1.83,0.96,145,46,40.7,37.8,0.6,0.78,6.6,9.34,0.91,25.72,0.67,0.64,26.73,3.66,0.22,0.65,0.14,0.07,0.21
B00NA6LO8I,4.0,heres my true assessment as of being a hallmark greeting card software user for over  yearsoverall the goodi use this mostly for my business where i have to keep in touch with clients so i send cards to both clients and family  having used hallmark software for over  years i can attest to the quality of this software  overall i am happy with the software and the cards this can produce  overall the cards are nice there is a large variety and you can customize most of the cards by using the art studio feature which allows you to alter the text and greeting or insert your own graphics and photos  in some cases the text is built in and you cannot change it because its part of the design but for most cards you can change the text  this means you can find a funny one meant for an uncle and you can switch it up to read brother instead of uncle  if you are creative enough you can even create your own cards from scratch or just edit the cover and text of an existing card for a completely custom look  another great feature is that when you install the software on your machine youll end up with all the hallmark fonts used for the greeting card program also available for use in word and other programs on your pc  i have been able to run this and older versions of the hallmark software on my windows   bit machine without an issueprintingprinting is easy and best done on a quality color inkjet printer  the colors come out truer on inkjets rather than laser printers  ive found by using laser printers the colors are dull and often there is toner staining that make the card look less professional and more amateurish  drawings and graphics print best on plain or textured paper where photographs print best on high gloss photo paper  the drawback about using photo paper is that you cant print the inside the card using the backside of photo paper so ive solved this by printing the outside on photo paper and the inside on plain paper and mounting the plain paper as a liner inside the folder photo cover  it makes the entire card look much more upscaleprinting double sided is easy just follow the online instructions for setting up your printer and you are on your waypaper and envelopesfor best results use high quality heavy card stock when printing your cards  the heavier weight stock adds a high quality feel to the finished printed card  ive never bought the hallmark papers and envelopes that they sell to be used with this software as any cardstock and envelopes will work and are generally much cheaper  the only thing youll be missing is the hallmark crown embossing on the envelope flaps but ive not found anyone who even noticed this  i go to the office supply store and buy greeting card envelopes measuring   x    they come in pastels ivory bright colors etc  pick up a ream of textured card stock in at least  to  pound weight  the pound measurement indicates how thick the cardstock is  the thickest your printer will accept the better  choose a plain whiteivory in a nice texture such as linen laid felt textured shiny glossy speckled etc  for most card printing projects i use off white felt textured for printing cards with drawings cartoons or illustrations and glossy photo stock for printing cards that have photographs  again when using glossy photo stock use a plain paper liner to insert into the folder cover  send the print job to your printer and instead of flipping the printed page over just insert a blank piece of paper and it will print the inside greeting  fold both the cover and the insert and use a glue runner or glue stick to affix the liner to the card  glue the back of the liner near the foldoverall the badthis software is not all that perfect  i dont often upgrade until several years have passed between versions  i find it irritating that when you own the  version and you upgrade to the  version half the cards appearing in your older version are still present in your newer version  when you pay to upgrade you should have all new cards not reruns of the old stuff you already own  they tout the fact that you will get  cards which is not a lie you do but they dont tell you that about  of those cards are from the previous version of their older software  after several years though most of the older cards are cycled out and they do put new cards in their place  so if you want to upgrade wait for several years before you dohallmark used to sell packets of new cards so you could keep upgrading and adding to your collection  they stopped doing that around  or so  it was a great feature because you could just buy new birthday cards if you wanted while keeping all your older cardsafter a while the cards in your existing collection will become stale  once you send a friend a card you cant really reuse it for that same person  you have to mentally keep track of which card you sent to whom  it would be a great feature if you could tag each card and add a name of the person you sent it to in order to keep track better  hallmark are you listeningsome of the greetings are kind of lame  there are some witty ones and some well written ones but there are many that are corny or seemingly outdated  how  does this greeting sound  like dawning after darkness like sunshine after rain things will seem much brighter when you are well again  it sometimes feels as if hallmark doesnt always put their best work in this collection so they can still drive sales of their cards in the store  fortunately there are enough to choose from so you can usually find a greeting card that fits or you can insert your own text to customize itsummaryoverall i would rate this product high and give it my recommendation  if you send a lot of cards you will save money by printing them yourself even if you buy high quality textured paper  the cost of a greeting card often exceeds  or more for the nicer cards and if you want to send personalized cards this is one of the best software packages

B00P6U8C5Y,1.0,vastly inferior to turbo tax i thought id give them a try again after i had completed the turbo tax online and found out how expensive it was going to be to file and print with them this year problem with hr block is they steer you into a wall quite often during the interview primarily with the state product it copied all the data from federal then left me hanging with no guidance on where to enter the withheld state income tax that i had paid it also dumped me out and gave me a bunch of complicated and confusing  guidance on depreciated real estate assets hey im not the brightest bulb in the pack when it comes to accounting and income tax prep but then again thats why i buy tax prep software after this frustrating experience with hr block software ill either go back to turbo tax or have a pro do my taxes next year,hampr block tax software premium  state  old version,34.99,0.6666666666666666,inf,13.25,-73.0,159,1,18,12,0,11,0,6,18,159.0,0.0,13.25,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.9167,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0,1.5,70,24,59,21,97,29,81,26,0.84,0.32,0.34,0.18,0.73,0.6,70,42,40.8,44.1,0.72,0.84,5.03,7.11,0.93,27.86,0.73,0.86,16.41,2.86,0.23,0.62,0.16,0.04,0.2

B000BX5IKI,4.0,aperture  is the first professional digital workflow tool i have owned and used extensively like many photographers i was in desperate need of something to help me manage thousands and thousands of pictures the workflow is easy to understand fast and has good sorting and selection capabilities the innovative stack tool is especially useful for sorting through dozens of nearly similar options of the same shot on my macbook pro unibody  intel core duo i am not experiencing any performance issuesmany reviewers focus on aperture as an excellent raw workflow tool and while it certainly is that it is every bit as useful for your jpegs in fact i primarily shoot jpeg except for when i expect to run into unusual exposure and color issues for which i will also shoot raw for my needs i find that shooting raw is quite often overkill and as a bonus transferring and processing jpeg is much less time consuming and requires substantially less storage spacethe adjustment tools may remind you of iphotos except there are more of them and they are much more capable and sophisticated that being said aperture is not a fullfledged image editor and many users will want to use aperture in conjunction with an external editor such as photoshop or photoshop elements external editors are well integrated into apertures workflow from within aperture you will be able to address most exposure contrast and color issues thanks to the strong tools in this category as well as retouching cropping rotation and some noise reduction issues all of these adjustments are performed nondestructively and can be undone selectivelyaperture accepts plugins and comes with one included in the box dodge and burn when using plugins aperture creates a new tiffversion of your original file actually more precisely of the version of your original file that you are working on my only objection to this workflow is that if you need to use several plugins on one image eg a dfine  noise reduction followed by some dodge and burn and perhaps pro contrast from nik softwares colorefx pro you end up with a new tiff file for every plugin you use as aperture plugins do not operate in layers like they would in photoshop for example i should also mention that i have on occasion experienced some stability issues with aperture and they almost always occur when using it in conjunction with plugins however these crashes have never compromised the integrity of the database aperture users will most often store their libraries as an aperture managed databasei have also produced a couple of photobooks which i have to say i have been very happy with the quality is good not as good as if you print your own on a highquality printer but good nevertheless youll find fewer predefined layouts than in iphoto but the ones that are here are more geared towards professionals one feature that seems to be lacking and that i have found useful in the past with other photobook vendors such as blurb is recommended resolutions for each photo based on the exact dimension of each frame with such a tool sharpness is optimized for each image that being said the lack of this tool did not seem to affect image quality too much in the aperture books that i orderedall in all aperture  is a very strong product and one that i now rely on entirely for my workflow i recommend getting a book about aperture i bought apple pro training series aperture  which will help you use the software more efficiently especially since the included documentation is pretty weak,apple aperture  old version,16.64,0.4892205638474295,,,-532.12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,221,91,200,89,382,127,310,125,0.81,0.4,0.41,0.13,1.14,0.76,221,43,40.8,40.1,0.58,0.81,8.0,11.31,0.91,28.05,0.65,0.72,36.63,4.28,0.16,0.62,0.15,0.04,0.18

B0055A7RS8,4.0,overall the product is excellent  ive used anytime organizer products for nearly  years now and i believe they are most easy userfriendly day calendarorganizer products on the market  the best part is the program is very easy to navigate around with very simple displays for day of the week week month and year  events and todo items can be very easily moved from day to day with no problem  a great quality is that the todo items can be prioritized with  categories from  then az and with  subpriorities which means you can assign about a thousand total priority levels to your tasks  i believe that is great to help keep you working on your hghest priorities throughout the dayanytime organizer has two negatives  one the importexport features are limited and not well explained in the user manual  it is difficult to import or export from other calendar software such as microsoft outlook  the other negative is that sadly the manufacturers customer assistance and software help is poor to nonexistent  that is the one part of this software that i would grade close to an f  although the software itself is easy to use dont count on any useful help from the manufacturer once you buy it,individual software anytime organizer deluxe ,9.98,0.6067961165048543,103.0,9.363636363636363,-137.62,206,1,27,22,2,15,2,4,28,206.0,103.0,9.3636,22.0,13.5,11.0,0.6818,7.5,2.0,1.0,2.0,0.1818,14.0,1.2727,86,28,77,26,128,32,106,30,0.83,0.28,0.33,0.3,1.8,0.95,86,36,39.8,40.0,0.67,0.8,5.38,7.6,0.92,25.71,0.73,0.85,14.45,2.69,0.16,0.72,0.19,0.06,0.25

B0077UGGQI,5.0,first off let me say that i am an absolute beginner on the drums and had never studied music  always wanted to play the drums so i bought a roland drum kit and started to watch the thousands of helpful free lessons videos on youtube it is amazing how many are out there and how many are actually very good  however  i came across this software and decided to buy it  it is by far the best thing i could have donesome pointsas mentioned in the other reviews youll need to have your computer screen in a location where you can easily see it and have your mouse nearby  youll need to purchase a midi usb cable and as mentioned before as well i would recommend a decent one and not the  one but that is your callset up was a breeze  you load the software connect your drum module to your computer via the midi usb cable open the software  and you are on your waythere are rudiment and beat exercises and then a bunch of songs to play along with on different levels easy medium hard  a fun feature is that you can put it in rockbandlike mode and play the songs similar to how you would as if it was a video game  i prefer using the notation mode as i want to learn how to read sheet musicthe absolute best thing about this is that you can control the tempo  even with the easy songs i find that i have to slow them way down learn the song and then increase the bpm in increments as i feel comfortable with my progress and you can upload free midi songs that you find on the internet into the software and it automatically charts the drum notations from the midi song onto sheet music or you can elect to play the uploaded song in the video game mode that i mentioned that midi song upload feature to me is unbelievable  i find myself using this software a couple of hours a night every night  in my opinion it is that good i know it works with all of the roland kits and i believe it also works with the other kits like yamahaanyway if you have any questions about it  ill try to answer my email is ,roland  vdrums tutor,7.99,0.4704370179948586,,,-297.99,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,132,41,116,39,223,60,186,57,0.83,0.31,0.31,0.11,0.65,0.57,132,40,42.3,39.7,0.59,0.77,6.25,8.84,0.9,24.22,0.62,0.75,30.56,3.91,0.22,0.57,0.11,0.04,0.16
B00NPVPSDU,3.0,ive been using bitdefender now for nearly a decade my tip always buy retail and never from them directly  it is never a good idea from a cost stand point with any antivirus  itll generally be cheaper you can sometimes find  months to a year for free and there seem to be a lot of complaints from people in regards to bitdefenders autorenewal  if you buy retail you dont run any risk of them making charges you didnt expect  ive had zero problems with charges using this approach  in short never give an antivirus company your credit card  ive seen other complaints about people not getting their rebates but have only had them come very late be it luck or whatever ive always received themanyway on to the program consistently rated as one of the highest detection rates by av testers and also come in at one of the cheapest costs for multiple licenses at home assuming you pay attention to sales they will allow you to upgrade any reasonably recent version you have to the latest probably so they dont have to debug different code bases and keep supporting old ones this has a benefit that you can get the new one cheaper but if it requires more than your system can do youre hosedi upgraded to  for free after  started doing some awful things to my system i was losing icons and some programs started requiring admin prompt to run the normal solution and get used to doing this if you buy is to do a repair install every one to three months whatever learning the program supposedly does is actually detrimental to your system performance theyve also pushed their stupid wallet addon in the last couple of years and it literally adds at least  seconds to my boot time even though i never use it and have told it to disable  we didnt bother upgrading my wifes windows  computer as it has experienced no issues aside from eventual slowdown running  but then she barely uses the laptop for more than watching video on the tvso why stay well aside from the repair installs it runs fairly well i rarely reboot preferring to either hibernate or sleep the computer so thats not as big an impact its detection has done well for me in the past and the price for three computers to use it for two years was extremely reasonable in short its cheap and works well enough that im willing to put up with a little hassle however id highly suggest if anyone from bitdefender reads these reviews that they focus more on fixing things that have been broken for multiple versions back that cause the slowdown and require repair installs rather than focusing on semiuseless new additions that few people will actually use,bitdefender total security    pc   year download,41.97,0.5641025641025641,,,-395.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,190,63,171,58,283,79,238,73,0.84,0.31,0.33,0.19,2.65,1.15,190,43,43.7,44.4,0.67,0.9,7.99,11.29,0.93,34.74,0.72,0.66,32.45,4.03,0.21,0.76,0.14,0.08,0.22

B00486U36I,3.0,update  after reading some of the newer reviews i am saddened to see that i didnt mess up my tomtom after all  my unit did take the route that everyone elses has and it no longer charges when you plug it in  the unit works just fine when its plugged in but instantly turns off as soon as you unplug it from the power source or shut the car off  that being said i still really like the unit when i have to use it its just very annoying to have to keep it plugged in  i only use it for very long car trips because i use my iphone apps for the shorter onesive been using tomtom gps systems for about  years now and ive never had a problem with them  when my last gps required a muchneeded map update i decided to purchase a new unit  the other one was at least  years old and the technology has come so far since then  i decided on this unit because i wanted all of the bells and whistles since i travel a great deal  i have had the unit for about a month now using it around the rural area that i live in as well as urban areas like philadelphia  the only thing that i found to be an issue is that if you do use the bluetooth calling feature it blocks out the next street name on the top  i knew that from reading the reviews so it didnt bother me  what does bother me about the bluetooth calling feature is that the person on the other end has trouble hearing your voice  im not sure if there is anything that could be done about that from my end  also you cannot upload any new voices from the internet yet  the default womans voice is very clear and easy to understand so i have no problems with this either  i just miss my british voice named tim if youre looking for a basic gps this may be overpriced and too involved for your use  like buying an iphone if you only want to make phone calls  i needed one with more options and this satisfies every need that i have  i did get it on sale though and had a  off tomtom option so that did cut the price down significantly  it paid to do my research  i also want to mention that i called the tomtom support line to help me decide between two devices and the gentleman on the other end was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the products,tomtom go   portable bluetooth gps navigator with lifetime traffic amp mapsdiscontinued by manufacturer,10.16,0.5023041474654378,,,-343.66,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,150,37,136,36,258,48,217,47,0.84,0.22,0.25,0.15,1.49,0.86,150,40,42.4,38.9,0.58,0.79,6.6,9.34,0.9,24.69,0.63,0.67,30.22,3.89,0.21,0.62,0.13,0.06,0.19

B000XHE0Q0,4.0,first of all i had to buy it because mac mail app doesnt allow exchange server mail configuration not yet snow leopard might moreover i am a firm believer of using the softwares sold by the same vendor as the os so this was not an obvious choice and just to let you know i am using only entourage so i dont know about the other apps however i have got to say that i have absolutely no complaints about the software as such this is a good piece of software from microsoft for a change it does all that i want it to do for my exchange server account syncs up well even using sloppy connection of roadrunner html mails render correctly check names in the active directory while sending mails keeps up with my exchange server calender and blah and blah and blah basically it is perfectly usable and intuitive monolithic pimnow all that should have fetched it a  star but i am giving it a  star for one reason i was using office mac  trial before i bought this now when i tried just using the product key to activate the trial version it didnt i check mactopia for help and it turns out that the keys which come with the versions bought from anyother vendor other than microsoft doesnt work that way this is kinda stupid i think still i can live with that so i uninstalled with remove office app which basically moved the entire office  folder from application folder to trash and didnt clean up in literal terms then i installed from the dvd no problem there however this version comes with  and ms recently released  for office mac the update was easily found and installed by the auto update app the problem starts there somehow after the update it thought i am still using trial version and asked me to key in the product key once again i had to remove the plist files from library folder to reenter the proper key and use it no problem since then turns out this is a known issue in  and the work around is properly described in mactopia so although it is a good product there are glitches in the update just fyi for the noobs you may have to follow the same work around after installing there is one more thing i was really surprised by the ram and hard disk footprint of this software it was really low and impressive entourage takes up about  of your harddisk space compared to mail appanyway will i suggest my friends to buy it sure if it is for exchange server rest of the mail accounts like gmail hotmail or anything its easier to use the mail app if you can live with it,microsoft office  for mac special media edition old version,165.0,0.4732334047109208,,,-385.62,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,163,63,145,60,295,93,242,89,0.82,0.37,0.39,0.19,2.49,1.11,163,39,40.7,40.2,0.55,0.78,6.71,9.49,0.9,23.68,0.6,0.65,28.47,3.77,0.18,0.57,0.14,0.05,0.18

B0016ZOUUO,5.0,update i originally gave this product  stars the  version of fluenz addresses the original concerns i and others raised about the inability to pick up where you had left off in a previous session so i now rate the  version of fluenz as  starsthe good the teaching method works it is essentially a classroom on my laptop with an instructor who explains the lesson ie conjugating the verb to want followed by speakinglisteningwriting drills the lessons build nicely the drills not only reinforce the current lesson but also contain review from previous lessons building ever more complex sentences fluenz has obviously put a lot of thought into organizing the progression of each lesson while the vocabulary is focused on the needs of someone on vacation it is far more than a phrasebook on dvd the program is also teaching prepositions noun genders and verbs but in a context that a tourist would find immediately useful where are you from my hotel is not far from here do you want to eat with us at the restaurant i already feel that i can create my own sentences from the building blocks ive been taught this is in sharp contrast to my high school german where we learned such immensely useful phrases as i have ten fingers while there is no robot accent checker you can record yourself and play it back to hear how you sound alternating with a native speaker this approach works fine for mecons the provided audio cds and downloadable podcasts are good but the printed materials are little more than a pocket survival guide in keeping with the classroom paradigm i think some printable notesflashcards for each lesson should be included at this pricebottom line i struggled with languages in high school and i am definitely learning with fluenz which is whats most important the cost of the program is comparable to two semesters of night classes at a community college so i dont think the price is out of line,learn french fluenz french  for mac pc iphone ipad amp android phones version ,258.0,0.5988023952095808,,,-259.08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,150,55,140,55,207,66,177,66,0.86,0.37,0.37,0.14,0.86,0.65,150,44,43.9,44.4,0.72,0.88,7.37,10.43,0.94,38.35,0.79,0.86,30.86,3.93,0.2,0.75,0.15,0.07,0.22

0321719816,3.0,i waited to complete the entire course before writing this review and in no particular order these are my observationsi should tell you that my web skills are limited i used front page for years and have created several very elementary dreamweaver sites for family members im in the process of trying to work more professionally cleaner less and better code and more creatively a less stilted and more unique and appealing design this course doesnt purport to be a web design course it assumes that you already have a basic idea for a relatively simple website and its going to teach you how to implement it dont expect inspirationpositive level absolute beginner to intermediate  it is entirely dvdbased the booklet  pages including index that comes with the dvd just provides additional random information it is in no way connected to the content or the sequence of the course the scope of the information presented is all that is needed for basic competence in the implementation of a simple dreamweaver  website you do become familiar with the dw interface the workflow best practices web and dw terminology and basic website structure and creation the sequence and progression is logical and sequential there is some reiteration of basic principles as the course progresses to clarify how something previously explained applies in a new situation the interface is very well thought out you can go backwards or forwards easily it has constant access to a table of contents that allows you to search by both topic and subtopics in case you want to navigate to a completely different topic it allows you to bookmark with long notestoself on topics of interest you may want to keep coming back to the interface coloring and design are neutral and unintrusive the screen always retains focus and the surrounding options melt away the course has the secondary purpose of preparing for the adobe certified expert ace test each main section has a practice test at the end another asset is that the video transcript is captioned under the viewing screen optional this is particularly helpful if youre in in a public place where you cant turn on the sound all explanations of hardtograsp concepts ex the box model are clearly demonstrated with visual examples as a matter of fact this is the clearest explanation i have ever seen of the box model i did find the booklet section on fireworks instructive since i have never used that program in the past in fact the entire booklet is very instructive and usefulits just totally unrelated to the course on dvdnot so positive coverage of other concepts such as content placement and positioning are a little more basic and less detailed than i would have liked i cant recall or locate now any reference to floats whereas ap divs and frames both older concepts are well covered the narrator has a pleasant voice and clear diction but is somewhat monotone and unexciting there is no search function or index this makes it impossible to look up a term or a topic that is not specifically listed in the table of contents i would have thought that the transcript text might have been searchable but it isnt for my learning style i would have preferred that the booklet function as support material for the video so i could follow along with text that directly reinforces the visual demonstration and is easier to go back to or use as reference material the bookmarks that you create when taking the course on your laptop are saved to that computer if you want to change to your desktop the bookmarks obviously are not there so as a personal index these bookmarks have their limitson the whole i do recommend this course i wish i had taken it earlier because it laid down the groundwork better than an online course that i had just taken however i think that for a person who is learningasyougo not just learning general theory but actually trying to apply it to a real website it is essential to have reference material on dreamweaver  some sort of guidance on design principles and a solid html and css anthologyall in wellindexed booksvideo and online courses teach you very well how to build their sample websites but when you are stumped on your website you need to be able to supplement the general principles they taught you with a more onpoint reference,learn adobe dreamweaver  by video core training in web communication,35.23,0.477792732166891,,,-674.22,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,285,101,266,99,458,128,386,126,0.84,0.33,0.35,0.25,5.81,1.7,285,44,43.9,42.7,0.62,0.86,9.42,13.32,0.92,34.37,0.69,0.78,55.4,5.26,0.18,0.63,0.17,0.05,0.22

B0098EENES,5.0,one year update jan  please see my original review below the updatei am still trying to finish a house we had some strange turns in our life so i am not a typical user when i bought the program i was trailing electronically behind an architect who was doing the work by hand eight months ago we moved and started all over with out house i am happy to say it is now almost finished when i got into that level of design i upgraded to chief architect which is the professional program i was able to rent it by the month to match our project there are a few steps to go through to be able to read a chief architect professional program on home designer but once you know it is no big deal i am still very happy with the program even with a high level of skill there are some quirks but that is not uncommon with a lot of computer programs after being a daily user of both of the chief architect programs here are a few pros and cons the pros far outweigh the cons and the improvements seem to be the ones that people were most interested in seeing changed kudos chief architectpro absolutely the best tech support i have ever experienced there are scads of video tutorials that are free the manual online is searchable even with poor organization of search terms when you dont quite know what you are trying to ask about when you do need a persons help someone is right on the phone with you to help i made a really big mess once and they asked me to send a copy of my entire file for them to review they posted an answer for me i was so surprised and they are just downright nice folks the  modeling allows you to do a lot of things i did not know as an early user for example you can pick a chair paint it with an eyedropper like you find in most color editing programs and then save the chair so you can use it again you can upload actual photographs and use them for your backgrounds so you can see how a project will look some of the irritating problems with grouping and aligning have now been fixed the align function works like powerpoints does the snap to functions are much much improved it is rare that i have trouble with this anymorecons it is still relatively expensive both the home designer pro and the professional chief architect programs are priced well for what they are but they are not priced for most casual users aligning floors and keeping paint colors in the rooms where they belong can get tricky you have to break the wall lines to keep the colors where they go which then sometimes causes the floortofloor alignment to get wonky setting ceiling heights in multilevel houses with twostory vaulted rooms is recalcitrant there are clear directions on how to do it but sometimes the program reads the space where the floor would go as missing and thinks that your ceiling heights are different which then locks your ability to change ceiling heights below this happens not too often but too often for me to not be frustrated i have learned to deal with it but it took me a long timeoriginal review jan  one reviewer raised the issue as to whether or not the reviewers actually used the program i am an actual user of this program i have other reviews posted at amazon and aim to provide information to others to help them evaluate whether or not a particular product meets their needs my review is long but i have endeavored to enumerate the key things that i have learned i like this product very much but do not think it is for everyone if it meets your needs i can recommend it highly i am extremely happy that i selected it when compared to other optionsmy summary reviewhome designer pro is an excellent program for amateurs doing real architectural work it is not a substitute for a program that a professional might use but it does have many of the same features it is very detailed and allows the user a deal of control however without experience or practice it is not an easy program to use if the extent of your computer software experience is ms word excel and powerpoint do not expect that you will be able to get right to the meat of this program those who bring to the desk knowledge of computers and of design and building will be the most quickly successful the price moves the program out of the casual users budget but it is well below a full professional program i believe it is an appropriate price for a program that yields such professional results for people working on their own or on projects of limited scope among similar programs i believe this one is the most robust for the knowledge and skill that the user has to bring to the tablebackground of my goals in purchasing the producti purchased this software hoping to have a program that would allow me to do real architectural activities not just draw floor plans my house burned down in one of the  summer wildfires in the rockies and the dwelling reconstruction is complex and i am very involved in the process i was reticent to spend  on a program that was marketed for nonprofessionals i decided to purchase the program after talking with their sales personnel who were very helpful and clear that if i did not like the program i could return it or upgrade to the professional version there are many things you can do in the fullblown professional program that you cannot do in the home version but overall i cannot find many things that an amateur would be missing if you are planning to be in business using the software i would recommend the professional line that is twice and more the cost of the home designer pro otherwise i think this is a fine productthe learning curve is steep i came to the software with experience in multiple statistical mapping and graphics programs the most basic functions were not hard the more complex and helpful functions are not click and go the require a thoughtful approach accompanied by experience in the software and patience with learning i estimate that it only took me a couple of days to learn to draw basic floor plans place furniture and fixtures and create a  model it took me more than a weeks worth of effort to learn about doing exteriors in relationship to the floor plan and the  renderings it took about another week to learn how to get the roof functions to work after about a month working with the program i can remember how to do stuff and can do most anything i want to do the work that i produce with the program is professional and is useful for the actual planning and building of my home it is something that can be used for bids and built from which makes me very happy i would like to be clear that it is not a substitute for a good architect or engineerthings that i like about the program it is very robust you can make mistakes and recover from them the file protection protocols are very good if you are working and forget to save the program automatically saves it for you it is not easy to overwrite versions of your document reducing the oh no function if you make changes and forget to save them or if you change and dont do a save as finding the previous file is a snap each time you open your file you will be prompted to select the one you are opening or a newer version it is nice to have the options the array of products and materials is truly astonishing one of the differences between home designer line and the chief architect line the professional line is the amount of access you have to materials there are more available in the chief architect line but the number and variety of products available in home designer is impressive it is possible to import information in multiple formats including jpg and tiff it will import dxf files but not dwg i have found this to be somewhat frustrating but interoperability between various cad programs is not as seamless as other types of programs the import and export protocols are generally excellent and allow you to import cad furniture etc from other places for example you can import backdrop jpgs so that you can have your  model sitting on the actual property where it will be built many product companies provide their catalogs to the users of the program for example sherwin williams paints are available you can also import gps coordinates the materials list function is extremely helpful you can compile the list by room by floor by building or by the entire project you can sort the materials so that you can view by all of your materials in a searchable categorized master list or by the total materials needed for a specified place within your larger project for example you can request  materials list for all bathrooms or one bathroom you do have to be very meticulous with the general building materials fittings fixtures and furniture that you use in the home because the materials list will catalog exactly what you put into the program early on i kept making duplicates of cabinets when i tried to place them i got  dishwashers piled on top of each other in such a way it appeared to only be one i got a bid back that included  dishwashers since that was on my list  the process seems to work best using it within the chief architectpro program but you can automatically export the files in comma delimited excel or html formats the computer requirements to run the program are not all that intense the computer requirement to run it well and fast are i work on multiple computers one that has  gb ram one with  and one with  i can tell a big across my machines it is not that you cannot use the program but the difference in how you use it are pretty important for example some products will not render on some computers with less power you can have the program installed on multiple computers if you move from one computer to the other to work you simply deactivate the license on one and reactivate it on the other the change is not hard and takes less than a minute to do i like being able to know clearly what i am doing with intellectual property it is nice not to have to guess if you are or are not following the specified rules the snaps and grids are robust you can draw a pretty poor line and it will straighten right up if you miss getting walls connected you can fix that by selecting one of the lines and right clicking select join line and then click on the other line the program is organized so that you make multiple stories in one plan it is a matter of a single click to go one floor to another if you want to see all of your floors at once that is possible one of the great features is the align with wall abovebelow this allows you to make sure that each floor is perfectly aligned without having to struggle with it yourself there are multiple types of  renderings from which you can choose some render very quickly with less detail and others take more computing power but are much more lifelike you can pick what you need for the moment one of the interesting options for  modeling that looks as much as possible like real life perspective view is to draw the whole house or just one floor this is very useful if you want to work on one place and do not want to render the entire building it is really nice to be able to show other people what you are thinking flat floor plans are extremely useful and are immediately clear to some people however i have found that i can do the  modeling and truly convey what i am thinking even if the other person has not been working on the project or have experience with reading blueprints the doll house views are extremely useful and downright fun the full model draws all of your floors say foundation  and  stories you can click up and down the stories and look inside of each floor you can look down useful to see if your framing lines up or you can tilt the view in any direction so you can see detail of how the building looks outside and even your decorator items inside and out in this or that spot you can send your documents to a layout option which is a blueprint format the number of text and video training options are laudable you can go to any online search engine and search for the topic of interest with the key word chief architect and you will have multiple options for instruction many are from the company itself they also monitor discussion groups and enter with answers when it seems appropriate comment see discussion with this review as an example the quality of the text and video training and tech support documents is some of the best i have ever seen for any program anywhere while there are some feebased programs the amount of free help is excellentthings to think about before you purchase the programthese are things that some might call limitations but i put into the category of reality check working with a complex  and  program is not point and click the program will do many things for you you can even use preloaded templates or space planning blocks however it is important for the potential user to think honestly about how they will use the program and what their skill level and commitment to using the program is the most important issuelimitation is the user knowledge required i must qualify this there are multiple levels at which you can work to work at even a moderate level the program is complicated the biggest hurdle is the users knowledge of the language and functions of design and building the are glossaries and tutorials available but that does not help a lot if you dont know what you are trying to learn it is expensive relatively the program is less expensive than some and more than others i think it is a good value but  is not cheap working in  requires some knowledge of working in x y and z planes you can edit in  but you wont be able to tell without doing a  if the pillow you placed on the couch is exactly lined up in x and y but is located  miles into space on the z plane it takes some practice while i was learning and i kept throwing house spinning out into the stratosphere we made a joke saying auntie em auntie em from the wizard of oz i must say this problem is not unique to the program it is endemic to working in anything  on a flat plane like a computer screen to run easily it takes a fair amount of computer horsepower this is not particularly concerning to me but this program probably wont run on a garden variety home computer that is used primarily for email and surfing the web i wish the program had easier align functions i have moderated this comment from my original review because of assistance provided in a discussion regarding this message i felt like chief architect was less competitive by not having an obvious way to align items as an example of why please note the discussion regarding alignment on this reviewi think this is a great program someone from someone from chief architect responded to the review and provided information as to how to address the problem the directions heshe give are clear this demonstrates one of the reasons i like the product they are out there and they offer assistance i must say that i have had difficulty with this function my experience has been that getting cabinets in a rowis not as easy as most of us have grown use to using programs like powerpoint  it may be a trivial but to me it would be better if the program incorporated a more intuitive or user friendly

B000BR0NPO,4.0,i switched to mac in december and got the os x  with the computer it runs smoothly and without a hitch which is very commendablei was not accustomed to the different tools and therefore have left some of them unused to this day i dont for example use the mail feature the ichat or the ical furthermore there are some applications that i dont think  fantastic for example safari which i did use for a short while but found to be utterly inferior to mozillas browser it will for example not open hotmailthere are far too many things in the os x that you dont need yet are still there and set up as standards which is a bit irritating it takes forever to find out where these files are hidden and changedelete them it is a lot harder in my opinion at least to tailor your computer to your needs with os x than with windows change settings and preferences and so onhowever there are redeeming factors the preview function that lets you look at most files without running the application that youd normally use to open them in is priceless that really comes in handy a lot the time machine function that makes a backup of your harddisk is also very handy and takes a load of your mind i have loads of photos and text that id rather not loose because of system failure and im sure that goes for most peoplethe search set up makes it fairly easy to locate a file you yourself have created but is otherwise very limited seeing that it doesnt search all folders i personally had a hell of a time trying to reinstall some adobe software because i couldnt locate a file that turned out to be in the library folder using the search functionin conclusion ill say that i dont think this is a superior operating system but it is definitely not inferior either i would like more personal control over things but i do get how it is nice that you can if you choose to just sit back and let apple handle everything for you i wouldnt switch to mac just to get to use os x but i wouldnt run windows on my mac either,apple mac os x version  leopard  family pack,119.99,0.525065963060686,,,-296.3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,146,54,131,52,234,64,195,62,0.83,0.32,0.37,0.23,3.52,1.33,146,41,41.7,42.9,0.62,0.84,6.75,9.54,0.91,27.4,0.67,0.66,27.56,3.71,0.22,0.7,0.14,0.06,0.21

B00CVBMLOE,3.0,i am a college student who uses a computer for all studying yes ive come up with a workflow for math too the copy restrictions on ebooks makes this workflow impossible so i make my own scans and use ocri used abbyy in the past but i wanted something that would better read math characters better format pages and better recognize images i bought omnipage ultimate because it was recommended to me by the salesrep who said omnipage would be able to do these things properly the rep because i bought naturallyspeaking student edition as well gave me a large discount on ultimateoverall i saw omnipage ultimate to perform satisfactory for ocr software but the issues with large files were a dealbreaker for mefirst the pros very good formatting of word documents very good ocr small footprint in memory    mb for me even with several large documents openomnipage ultimate had an edge over abbyy in preserving the formatting of textbook pages headers footers paragraphs and titles were all placed almost exactly as they were on the original page the images it recognized were wellplaced too however it did not recognize complex mathematical formulas as images  but as a discombobulation of garbage characters it would also confabulate graphs that contained recognizable characters a con best mentioned here is that omnipage would sometimes flip pages the wrong way and there would be no messages about the program detecting the possibility of a page having the wrong orientation a feature ive yet to see or find in abbyy or omnipage is detecting outoforder or missing pages via the page number in the headerfooter ie the scanner grabbed the wrong page first or two pages were glued togetherat the heart of the program  its ocr ability  i give it high marks uncertain characters were uncommon and i did not often stumble across incorrect characters omnipage occasionally preserved bold and nearly always recognized italics when i enabled the greek dictionary omnipage even recognized some mathematical characters i have not yet tried this in abbyyomnipage seems to be efficient at keeping a small footprint in memory and does not consume much of my cpus resources even considering only the cores it actually uses ive had several documents open at once each roughly averaging  and omnipage will only consume  of memory omnipage worked relatively fast with smaller documents approx less than  size and demonstrated a linear performance curve with ocring larger documents however i do recommend restarting the program after extended use because it may bog downnow the cons some are dealbreakers for me very slow at saving relatively large documents seemed to handle  pages well but performance for  pages exponentially decreased very slow at opening relatively large documents same here large documents may be corrupted ouch no happy medium with pdf output sizequality pdf document output is either extremely large and high quality or extremely compressed and relatively low quality some scanners are not fully supported check the list could use some improvement because abbyy does this well in my experience weird randomly deleted characters in titles of image scans workflow inconveniences frustration with not being able to find help or search results related to these problemsnotefor the troubles ive had i must first mention that i have an  amd  of ram windows   and an otherwise wellfunctioning computer when the program ran smoothly there was a respectable impression on  of the  cores when the program slowed to a crawl and struggled with large documents the cores were barely above idle and memory was about twice the norm    there seems to be some sort of bottleneck in the program where it becomes increasingly unable to utilize system resources for saving and loading larger and larger documents this seems to be exponential as an approx  page document with the same scanner settings as a  page document took several times longer to save and load  in short larger documents were saved  loaded more slowly than they should have otherwise been  pages took about  minutes  pages took about  minutes  both for saving and loading finally my  page document  selfscanned and errorchecked while putting up with this programs sluggishness  was corrupted with a file io error for every page after saving for a third time yes i spent around three hours just waiting on the program to save and load the file a few times omnipage finally ruined the opd omnipages proprietary native document format after i had it ocr the whole thing and save itfor a highquality pdf i must select optimize for quality in the searchable pdf save options window this generates a pdf that can be anywhere around  times the size of omnipages own opd for the documentfor a highlycompressed pdf just select anything but optimize for quality yes optimize for size   etc all do the same thing compressionwise  for the background image there is no compressionratio slider for mrc or most importantly the background image mrc options which are unavailable when optimize for quality is selected have a noticeable effect on appearance of text but account for little of the size of the file for background images there are only options for jpeg jbig flate lzw adobe xi turns up an error when lzw is used and losslessmediumbest compression changing any of these options for the background image produces roughly the same result in file size and image quality  which are always tiny and highly compressed abbyy seems to produce similar to smallersized pdfs that look betterthis is a big thorn in the side for me i have a fujitsu  its flatbed scanner is very fast in addition to its adf  its a highspeed scanner allround when i use omnipages native interface it only lets me use adf i have to go into the menus each time i want to change scanning preferences unless i use the twain driver when i use the twain driver interface i can use the adf or flatbed but i cant seem to find the option for continuous flatbed scanning i have to roll my office chair from the scanner to the computer select add more pages then select scan in the twain driver each time i want to use the flatbed with abbyy its native interface allows me to choose between the adf and flatbed and the pause interval between flatbed scans  each time i scani am not sure how to accurately describe what is going on here when the scanner scans a page and it gets imported into omnipage sometimes chapter titles large font seems to be the key will have missing or filledin os ds and cs they will be completely erased from the source image  replaced with the adjacent background color unavailable for ocr and missing in pdfs or they will be filled in with black coloring  unavailable for ocr and appearing as so in pdfsthere are some little things about omnipage that prevent it from truly shining i cant cover everything in detail but these details are nonetheless important first if i insert pages into the adf incorrectly they may be out of order or rotated wrong the only way i have found to fix this in omnipage is delete the pages and try being more attentive the next time i insert the pages i cannot run a command to reverse the selected pages order or correct frontsidebackside order and i cannot select multiple pages and flip them all at the same time i can change processing options in the optionsprocessing window to insert newly scanned pages beforeafter current pages which is convenient  but i cannot renumber pages without selecting and dragging which can be very slow and cumbersome image enhancements seem to be limited to either being done one page at a time or via image preprocessing in the optionsprocessing windowfinally with all of the tech issues ive had in omnipage i have not been able to find any documentation forum posts or help topics of others having these issues,omnipage ultimate

B00LX4BZAQ,5.0,wow i am extremely impressed with this version of dragon i had a previous version so four years ago that did not work very well in fact i opted for the builtin speech to text recognition in windows  i am now upgraded to windows  and unfortunately windows dictation capabilities are extremely poor i decided to give dragon another chance seeing that it has a  day moneyback guarantee i purchased the internet download and had it running in about  minutes so far i have been extremely pleased the words appear on screen almost as fast as i am speaking and thus far the words have been extremely accurate i have had to make very very few corrections this works directly in this amazon dictation box for this review it also works with wordpad and facebook directly what i mean by directly is that does not have to open a separate dialog box to dictate into and then transfer the text to the website it also works directly with word  some dictation software in previous versions of dragon did not work directly with the  software because it works differently than word  or   quick update  i have just discovered that while the nuance dragon software is running my  key keypad does not function properly when using the windows  calculator you can type numbers into a document and you can type numbers into the calculator however the plus minus multiply and divide keys do not work and you cannot perform computations this is not a huge deal for me but for somebody that needs their  key to be operational on a whim while simultaneously dictating may want to think about this perhaps it will work with a another calculator or software calculation program i dont have one at this time to test,dragon naturallyspeaking home ,27.99,0.5268456375838926,,,-231.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,110,35,98,35,194,43,156,43,0.8,0.28,0.32,0.12,0.58,0.54,110,38,39.2,36.9,0.57,0.73,5.58,7.9,0.89,21.24,0.63,0.67,19.56,3.13,0.19,0.62,0.1,0.07,0.17

B005GI18EI,4.0,i am not an security expert and i dont pretend to be one in real life this review is based on what i found and my own preference on how security software should function you might look at it differently but hey this is my review go write your own i completely trashed norton antivirus  in one of my reviews on pc world and i read a lot of users had similar problems and turn away from the product back then so i am going to do some comparison  to its old self and give it some justicebefore reviewing for this particular software i want to get to  points because they are going to be relevant latter in the writing security software is like a car insurance you really dont know how good it is until something bad happens and you are caught in the middle of the mess no virus zoo tests perform by independent labs can emulate what is going to happen in the real world i am just need to get it out there the first line of defense is the user not the antivirus software if the users are clicking on random links and running  softwares while downloading torrent something is going to go through no matter what you have running on the computer unless you are running linux then your risk is lower it is almost impossible to remove a virus once it excuses on your system someone out there is going to tell you it is possible but my response is always the same how do you know it is all clear look up rootkit on wikipedianow back to the review this writing is based on few standards i have  does it actually slow down your system  is the user interface clean enough antivirus  won me back i have been a norton antivirus fans up until  that was the time symantec lost it that was a period of time where norton antivirus itself functions more like a virus it takes forever to startup program would lag for  to  seconds after i clicked on it wrost scanning a  gb drive took  to  hours to finish a lot of users were complaining about it an i was one of them who switched to a different software nod  if you care and it is still a great software symantec took the feedbacks and completely rewritten their engine at first i was skeptic and continued to use solution that was little known to people back then  and kaspersky mainly because they were light and have great detection rate kaspersky was the first antivirus offered hourly update while other offered update every  to  days after my  license expired recently i decided to give norton another look and man i was impressed the software load up pretty fast on my computer intel   gb ram windows  with little system slow down just like  norton finished loading into memory in few second after login and just sits there waiting for the next action  solution such as kaspersky sorry kaspersky you used to be one of my two favors will take a minute or so to finish doing something i dont know what that is but the something is writing to and from the disk constantly for the first minute or so when kaspersky was on the system even with boot timescan options turn off this happened pretty often for few other software brands i am not going to point them out one by one user interface is something most of the antivirus software designers dont get they are either super complicated that makes you feel like you are about to launch a space shuttle or they are so simple that nothing can be change at all i remember the norton antvirus from old day had about ten taps on the type of scan you can turn on and off from the program such as pop smtp integration to word and outlook aim ie etc i remember writing a review on pc world a lot of these options are pointless forced integration into other software will only a slow the third party software down and b likely to break when the third party software update for example the integration into aim never worked for me because i was using a green version of aim that didnt have ads another thing that stuck to me was the notification box back then the software would pop you a notification and let you know it is working on something that is the wording norton antivirus is working on background tasks something along that line  but it doesnt tell you what the tasks were and no potion to pause it what is the pointnorton  is a lot better the user interface is easier to navigate i like the new design where it lightup at areas where a virus is reported it is pretty options are fairly easy to access and the scan option is right there at the first page so i dont have to look for it furthermore the software tells you when it was last updated and whether there is a problem and the notification is no longer intrusive thats is great although some of the options are still confuse ie the reputation scan why cant this be part of the smart scan doesnt bad reputation often means ad ware and reliable scan this sounded like something from the norton system work days but this is an antivirus why do i want to know whether a file is going to crash save it for norton so does it detect  virus in real world i dont know it is more of a blind faith look at it this way if the software tells you it caught something it must be working but when you dont get a wanring in  or so days while you are doing daily tasks does it mean it is working or does it mean something got through the realtime protection and you just dont know about itthe good thing is norton antivirus  appeared to be doing pretty well on all the independent lab tests along in reviewers from pc world and pc magbut then again the user is the first line of defense you got a flu shot doesnt mean you want to let other people sneeze at you,norton antivirus    user   pc old

B005S4Y13K,4.0,i have used turbotax for several years and have had generally adequate success with it some iterations have been more trying than others but overall i found the deluxe  product to be somewhat better than in years past the return appears to be accurately prepared and the interview interface is less confounding in some areas than in the past the capital gains and charitable contributions sections though are sometimes needlessly convoluted and the worksheets produced if you want to print the whole thing for your records are mammoth my return with all records and worksheets was  pages long each charitable contribution got a three page charitable organization worksheet that is nothing but a waste of paper if you give to a lot of charities each year which i do the dimensions of your records will astound you of course the actual return for filing is much smaller so saving the full set on a cd is most likely adequatethe other irritants are the aggressive promotion of turbotax premier if you have any interest or investment income i have used premier in the past but dont see any way it would have helped me in my situation it may help some people with more complex returns but if you have runofthemill interest dividend and capital gains income deluxe is probably sufficient i do think the badgering from intuit to buy ancillary services is a bit better than in years past honestly besides the pitch for premier and audit defense its pretty benign for  the interview is extensive and worded in a much more userfriendly way than in years past there are still occasionally puzzling questions to make you wonder what they are trying to get at but their help section was able to make quick work of it i had a question on a property sale and it was quickly resolved one thing i would like is for intuit to make it easier to enter data in the order in which you wish as everyone has different recordkeeping and organizational systems you can skip around but its much easier and less errorprone to do it in the order which they have devised another issue which i find extremely irritating is getting to intuits privacy policy and opting out of mailings email etc from them it is a real challenge to find this and i recommend doing it right off the bat if you want to because otherwise you will forget about it i did it when i registered but even then i believe i had to search for privacy options with the help functionfrom an ease of use vantage point installation download of my state return data and updates were a breeze im using a windows machine and i had zero problems with the program itself which is a huge blessing i have not been as lucky with some previous incarnations the questions took me through every aspect of my finances for  and with the exception of the property sale question i couldnt find anything it overlooked i have used turbotax in most of the last fifteen years and found  to be one of the best years yet i have tried the competing hr block software taxcut in a few years and while it produced adequate results i found the interface to be much less userfriendly than intuits though i didnt use it this year of course and as a result i plan to use turbotax deluxe for  as well,turbotax deluxe federal  efile  state  for pc download old version,59.95,0.4784110535405872,,,-507.76,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,202,71,189,69,349,88,287,85,0.82,0.3,0.35,0.22,3.46,1.32,202,41,41.8,39.9,0.58,0.81,7.65,10.81,0.91,27.23,0.66,0.62,28.59,3.78,0.16,0.62,0.15,0.05,0.2

B00505VMXY,4.0,the individual videoss are easy to follow along with and dont require any prior knowledge in order to figure out and understand the concepts being explained each individual video does a good job in explaining that part of the software its broken up into small lessons basically so you can do a few each day or just spend a few hours and watch a whole bunch at once you do find yourself wanting to watch just one more today and then maybe just one more hehe and time goes by quickly as you learn this i feel is a good thing and its better than having to force yourself to sit through extremely boring videos it makes learning excel  much easier than trying to read a book at least for me anywayi didnt give it  starts simply because i do think the way the individual videos are accessed on the disc can be improved the way it is now you have to sort out yourself thru the different folders to find the video files that will play on your system that is how i see it there appears to be different formats of the same lesson files in folders so i guess depending what software you have installed then that is the format you would chose to be honest i havent totally completed the lessons yet myselfi got distracted with other stuff during the holidays but look forward to getting back to the lessons i did find them enjoyable overall i hope this helps you determine whether this training disc full of videos will help you or nothave a great  everyone on amazoneditupdatei commented in my review that i thought the menu structure of the way you access the videos could have been better but it was my own oversight which prevented me from clicking on either the excel  or the excel  file depending on which video type plays better on your particular machinewhich then opens up a detailed disc structure and lesson plan layout which then is used to start whichever lesson plan video you chose from there therefore i do think the menu is also just as polished and professional as the individual video clips themselves arei recommend this highly for anyone wanting to learn excel  no matter their prior skill level,excel  training videos ndash  hours of excel  training by microsoft office specialist expert and master and microsoft certified trainer mct kirt kershaw,49.95,0.5494791666666666,,,-301.37,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,143,32,127,30,233,46,198,43,0.85,0.22,0.22,0.14,1.41,0.84,143,40,41.0,41.7,0.61,0.8,6.62,9.37,0.91,26.43,0.64,0.75,39.56,4.45,0.27,0.62,0.13,0.05,0.18

B00266PHEK,3.0,this review could have gone very very badly had it not been for roxios excellent support website and their intrepid pr person who kept the dialog going when i was ready to wash my hands of the whole thingthat said the last thing i wanted to do was start yet another review with i really wanted to like this product butover the last four months when i unfortunately had a lot of time on my hands a victim of the current economic unpleasantness since resolved and i am again very happily employed i decided i needed to regain some storage space in my increasingly cramped townhouse my collection of several hundred vhs tapes had to go there were however  titles i wanted to keep and decided to put them on dvd i had planned on doing this almost two years ago and found a superior and expensive analog to digital video converter a canopus  which i was able to find at a very acceptable price on ebay i set up my vhs deck in my computer room connected the video and audio outputs to the  inputs and sent the output to my dual  ghz mac  towers firewire port still running mac osx  and into my copy of imovie hd from ilife  each two hour tape took up  gb of disk space in the dv file format i quickly trimmed unwanted video at the start and end and inserted chapter markers when the tapes had multiple programs or if i was putting two  hour tapes on a single two hour dvd these chapter markers directly imported into idvd where i picked a theme edited the captions and burned the final dvd on my  tower the process of rendering two hours of video before the dvd could be burned took  hoursi repeated this process on my black macbook with a  ghz  processor and  of ram and everything worked about the same except the render time took a few hours less thanks to the speedier processormostly i started the recording process just before i went to bed the next morning i spent about  minutes editing the dv file pushed it to idvd and let it render most of the day by late afternoon i had another dvd for my briefly empty shelves it took about  weeks to finish the process and i was able to put all the gear awayenter  own john nemerovski thats nemo to you who had heard about my project and thought he had a great review project that was right up my alley roxio had just released a macintosh version of their popular easy vhs to dvd product and was looking for reviewers in spite of my reputation for writing negative reviews on this site he gave the job to me anywayi received the package which contained a cd getting started guide a roxio video capture usb device the brains of this outfit a short usb to usb extension cable and a breakout cable with stereo audio composite video and svideo connectors the cd contained the easy vhs to dvd for mac software as well as a very limitedfeature version of toast the roxio video capture usb device looked suspiciously like something from elgato makers of a number of magical video products that bring video content into your mac via the usb  port the big difference however is the software the elgatobranded device outputs  video while the roxio device outputs  files the same format as commercial dvdsi installed the easy vhs to dvd software on my  tower connected the roxio video capture usb device to the front usb  port and connected the audiovideo breakout connecting cable to cables from the output of my vhs recorder when i launched the software i was immediately directed to roxios website to download and update the software taking the revision level from version  to  i went through the easy setup procedure more on that below and tried to record some video at the end of  hours i clicked the stop button and in the next window clicked the send to imovie button my mac spent the next two or so hours converting the  file to an intermediate format but instead of opening the file into imovie as the instructions suggested they would i got an error message stating the program could not find the imovie program thinking id done something wrong and tried it again if id been just a little bit smarter id have recorded five minutes of video and not two hours and got the same results after hunting around the hard drive i found the  file in the movies folder at the top level of my home directory when i opened it in quicktime player i immediately spotted a problema massive number of dropped frames i then checked the size of the fileabout  should have been somewhere around  gbi repeated the above step with my macbook and at least got a  gb  file with no evidence of dropped frames but still got the imovie error i went to the roxio support boards excellent by the way with very responsive support people and discovered many others were experiencing the same problemthinking it was at least partly my fault i bought an additional  of ram and went to  to buy a copy of ilife  im still using macos x  which is not compatible with ilife  i found a great deal for an oem disk for around about a week later another updater came out version  same problems with both issues dropped frames on my  and no automatic opening of imovie hd around this time i was contacted by roxios intrepid pr guy wanting to know how things were going boy did i tell him in a couple of days i was granted access to a beta version of an upcoming patch i downloaded and installed it and viola no more dropped frames though still no automatic opening of imovie hd it also opened imovie  part of the ilife  package which only served to remind me how evil imovie  really is i had forgotten that apple in their infinite wisdom eliminated the ability to enter chapter markers where you want to add them since restored in imovie heres what i found from my research the easy vhs to dvd software is not compatible with imovie hd it will not automatically launch imovie hd and load the finished movie into it that function works fine on imovie  and while i personally didnt have the chance to see it in action it probably works equally well with imovie  the dropped frame problem was almost universal among dual processor  users the beta patch resolved the dropped frame problem on dualprocessor  machines and permitted automatic launching of imovie  and imovie  as a workaround you can make imovie hd process the  file by manually dragging it from your movies folder directly into the imovie hd application window it will take fair amount of time for imovie and quicktime to convert the file into something that imovie better understands roxios web support is very good their support staff monitors traffic on the message boards on a very regular basisi detailed this story to share my pain with the readers knowing that most of you would not have had this much patience or persistence and would likely have demanded your money back weeks before i finally achieved success but then again i am a very tenacious problem solver and tend not to give up easilyokay now that ive gotten that out of my system i can tell you that with the latest beta release software which will probably be finalized very soon and made available on their support site it mostly works as advertised other than the pesky imovie hd issuesheres how it workslaunch the easy vhs to dvd for mac software and the first screen above is displayed this is where you enter a name for your project use a pulldown menu to set the approximate length of your video and set the quality level for the file standard or high with another pulldown menu when you click the continue button the next screen is displayedyou are prompted to test your cabling to ensure your connections are functional a small video monitor screen shows your video source if everything is hooked up correctly click continuethe next screen repeats this process for audio to ensure the software is decoding the audio from your source click continuethe overview screen continues previewing video and audio if you dont see the picture or if you cant hear anything coming out of your macs speaker you get one final opportunity to go back and fix the problems once you are satisfied start your tape rolling and click the start recording button that same button is used to stop recording when you are ready to do so if you are operating this product unattended you might want to click the handy checkbox that automatically stops recording based upon the recording time you set in the first screen the benefit of doing this is that you wont totally fill your hard drive with garbage if you forget to come back and stop recording after an extended period of time remember in the high quality mode you are eating up disk space at the rate of  per hour in eight hours you could wind up using over  of disk spacewhen you click the stop recording button you are taken to the finish up screen which gives you the option to automatically open toast and begin the process of recording the video to dvd the edit with imovie button starts a conversion process that takes an  video file into another intermediate file format before importing into imovie  or imovie  send to quicktime player converts the file to  format before opening the quicktime player application note that the edit with imovie and send to quicktime player functions require an additional hour or two to convert the video into compatible file formatsquality in a word its great at least with vhs tapes that didnt have a whole lot of quality to begin with the better the source the better the converted file will be at  it beats the solution i had been using by many hundreds of dollars this same product can be used nearly anywhere in the world as it automatically detects and configures itself to output to the analog ntsc or pal video standardsthis review could have gone a completely different way thank goodness it didnt after a few weeks of troublesome operation the last software release solved nearly all the problems i was experiencing in all likelihood the copy you buy today will include the latest updates and you should have a wonderful experience with easy vhs to dvd for mac as with any video project the faster your computers processor the more ram and the more fast hard disk space the more you will be satisfied with this and other video processing products you will quickly learn that working with large video files requires a lot of patience while your computer and i dont care how fast it is plows its way through the fileseven with all the other difficulties i will say that the software was always stableit never crashed in the several weeks i used itproslow price brings video conversion to the masseseasy setupsaving files in  format reduces final rendering timecan save in   formatsgreat qualityconsinitial problems with very buggy softwaretoast  basic has very limited feature setincompatibilities with imovie hd in spite of advertised claimsprocessing time is slow slow slow though not really roxios fault video files are big and take a long time to processthe final rating would have been higher had it not been for the problems i suffered through with the supplied software i went through far more hoops than most customers would tolerate even with the able

B001LQO4P4,3.0,this item was convenient and easy to setup and use and it does work well  the software however is pretty bare bones its enough to get the job done but is limited in functionality and in some cases is more difficult to use than id like  specifically when editing a video for length or to remove a section the trim points move framebyframe which is nice if your near the stop point you want to trim but moving it only a few seconds forward or back using the slider instead of framebyframe is difficult to do on longer videos not granular enough so your forced to get close then go framebyframe and if you even just  seconds away thats a lot of frames to click through  so i wish it had a gototime feature or an adjustable movement ratethere are a variety of menus to choice from and they even have music but you cannot edit buttons or button placement or really any aspect of them  also i wish you could dragdrop to reorder the movies you are about to burn to disc you cant capture one long movie and insert chapters you have to capture each segment you want to be a chapter as a separate movie then each movie becomes a chapter in the finished productso basically if youre looking for simple to set up and use and arent the type to want to set up transitions and custom music etc etc then this is a fine solution  if you want more creative movie creation capability youll need to obtain some more advanced software than comes with this item, roxio easy vhs to dvd old version ,49.68,0.5904059040590406,,,-186.68,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,108,38,96,35,160,48,132,45,0.82,0.34,0.35,0.26,3.13,1.25,108,41,41.3,39.5,0.68,0.8,6.04,8.54,0.92,28.46,0.73,0.72,23.67,3.44,0.25,0.75,0.15,0.08,0.23

B00F8K9KZS,4.0,i have been a believer in turbo tax as my primary way of filing for a few years now and this version is similar to the previous years software  even though i am a fan of tt i do have a few gripes about the software  one of my main gripes is that i think that there are too many versions of this software  i really wish they would sell one turbo tax that allows you within the software to use the version you need and then charge you accordingly instead of having to figure out which version to purchase and get  in my case i have mutual funds so do i get deluxe or premier  i dont really handle the sales of the investments within the funds but i do know the fund management company does move things around from time to time  so what do you do i have used deluxe in the past with no issues but elected to go with premier because of its advertised extra help on investments  how much this extra help is and whether it is worth it to go from deluxe to premier remains to be seen and i will update once i file  i just personally think these multiple versions are confusing the for the average consumer who isnt familiar with the type of product that they would need for their tax filing  the tt website helps some with this but still i still leaves too much confusion for someturbotax has also increased the price a bit of this software which can be pricey depending on the version you need that is essentially the same with some changes for the new tax year which occurs every year as the previous years version  i am just not sure what changes justify this increasein addition to the upfront cost of the software purchase is one of my complaints that i have year after year is the additional cost that tt charges you for efiling with the state  this little detail is usually hidden away in the fine print and can cost you up to  bucks to efile for each state  really  it costs that much extra to electronically transfer data to the state for filing  i think that this should be a little more reasonably priced especially considering you are paying what you are for the software or in this case the yearly use of the softwareanother small complaint is the numerous updates that tt has throughout the tax season i can understand and appreciate the state and federal tax form updates as sometimes states make last minute changes but the one thing that i dont understand are the updates for bug fixes for the program interface which like i said has changed very little in the last few years  you would think that tt would have that part of the program squared away for the given year without having changes in the program throughout the year even after the filing date expiration  i mean how do you explain to the irs that you have a miscalculation due to a bug in your software although to be fair to tt that has never happened to mefor all my complaints though you would think i dont like this program but that is not true  i like this program for my taxes and i think it is the best tax software out there  it is quick easy and does a good job at helping you get your taxes done correctly with a pretty good and accurate return and i recommend it for those of you wanting to do your own taxes  even though the software is pricey it is cheaper than going to a tax preparer especially if you have to file for something other than the ez formas far as pricing and the promotion here with amazon i am less than impressed  i would prefer a better price and better promotion than having to subscribe to prime to get  bucks off or spend on a gift card  i would have preferred last years deal with better pricing and a chance to get  bucks off quicken  if you shop around there are places that have the premier version for  bucks and you dont have to subscribe to prime,turbotax premier fed  efile  state  old version,89.99,0.38429172510518933,,,-635.31,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,195,57,178,54,416,85,350,82,0.84,0.23,0.29,0.13,1.74,0.93,195,31,38.4,35.8,0.47,0.73,6.76,9.56,0.87,20.85,0.51,0.59,33.49,4.09,0.16,0.48,0.14,0.05,0.18

B001K6PA1C,4.0,earlier this year i reviewed the new bento personal database software from filemaker though it has limitations and lacks many desirable features of a database system i found it to be impressive as a way to store personal information and a lowcost solution for easily tracking  your data and keeping organizedfilemaker recently released an updated version bento  which adds several improvements and makes the program even easier to use in this review i will basically concentrate on the new features  particularly those i found most valuable upon installing bento  i immediately received an update message and proceeded to download  bento  which mainly fixed several bugs in the program if you are updating from the original version bento  will update each of your existing libraries during this process a backup version of all your database information  in the original bento format will be created which will allow you to downgrade to the original bento if ever neededif you are familiar with the mac programs itunes and address book you will readily understand bento  cataloguing system each individual database that you create is called a library  you can make subdivisions of that library into categories that are called collections each library is designed for a specific task ie inventory expenses contacts sales and event planning  there are  readytouse library templates included in the program which can be easily modified to meet your individual needs  you can create your own custom template from scratch and now download templates that have been created by other usersbento  offers two views of the data stored in your libraries table view and form view the table view is like a spreadsheet and the new table view is much more flexible and useable you can now add new fields change the field type and basically create  or edit your form from the table viewbento  introduces a new split view the split view allows you to see both the table view and the form view at the same timethe form layout can now be changed without having to enter a customize mode simply click near a fields edge to select it you then can move or resize it change the font size etc just click inside the field to edit the dataone feature i was glad to see improved was the import and export options you no longer need to import and export data only as csv files it is now possible to import and export data from and to numbers excel or a text file  in fact you can simply copy and paste the data from numbers and excel into bento  and vise versa with the original version of bento i was unable to import my old apple works databases but with bento  the files transferred quickly with no problem this function will now work with any database that supports tabdelimited filesindividual library templates can now be exported allowing you to share your favorite templates with other bento users you can also import  templates from others  with a simple drag and drop individual bento library templates contain the fields and forms from a library but not the data nor can you copy a form from one library to another library  if you want to use the same form you must recreate the form directly in the desired librarynever get lost again just click the new button near any address in a library to automatically display maps and driving directions from the webthe printing options in bento  have been improved now you can print more than one record per page in form view and the fit to width option makes columns automatically fit the width of the page however you still are not provided a lot of tools to create nice printed reports which could be a disadvantage if you want to use bento for your small businessbento  allows you to link apple mail messages to a bento library just drag and drop the message into the new message list field you can then view the message from within bento using quick look or use the view in mail capabilities to open the message and replyone definite disadvantage with bento is its lack of networking ability you are unable to  share the databases with  others or to sync information between computers bento  is available in a family pack which is a good buy but it just  gives you five single computer user licensesi was disappointed that the new bento version still did not provide any security you are unable to password protect a library that may contain sensitive information this is a big problem if you want to keep track of financial information account codes or other information to which you wish to restrict accessincluded on my wish list of features i would like to see  in bento  is integration between bento and iphoto so you can more easily add photos to your bento librariesthe cost of bento  remains at  for a single user license there is no price break for updating from the original version you still pay  a family pack is  bento is a real bargain  for those of us who want to keep organized but dont need a fullblown database program such as filemaker pro i found the upgrade added enough solid features and improvements to justify upgradingbento  may not meet the needs of all businesses or organizations due to its deficiencies such as the  lack of scripting  and mutliuser access but for those of us that need a  simpler solution bento is a great way to easily organize information without having to invest hours in database instructionsnot sure bento  is for you download the free  day trial version and check it outbento  requirementsa macintosh computer with an intel

B005O24H9Y,5.0,in my day job as an accountant i use microsoft excel every day and have for years  ive actually been using it for several generations now  currently im working with excel  and i find it just as user friendly as alwaysfor those unfamiliar with excel it is a spreadsheet program  thats right this isnt something that normal people use on a daily basis or even look forward to using  in fact it can be a little intimidating when you open it and see a grid with letters on the top of the screen and numbers along the sidenext to the accounting software this is the program i use the most for work however  each of those parts of the grid called a cell can contain data  i can put words in there or numbers  once ive got the numbers in there i can quickly add up large columns of numbers or manipulate them however i want with various formulas  need to correct a typo  no issue the formula automatically recalculates everything for you  i can sort  i can copy and paste even from other programs  ill dump stuff from my accounting software in here and work on it  i download weekly statements from our bank to do reconciliations  by cutting pasting and sorting i get stuff that i can easily use to stay on top of this mammoth task  heck weve got a file we created to allocate interest from our savings account across  subaccounts  it even then creates the journal entry for me and creates a format we can use to copy it back to our accounting softwareand yes i use it at home too  i keep track of stats on some of my hobbies in various excel files at home  i also keep my personal checking account balance in a spreadsheetas you can see excel can be used for simple or complex tasks  you can create graphs based on the information in your spreadsheet and there are more complex features i have never used  once you get over the initial hesitation the number of ways you can manipulate your data is addictingto be honest i dont remember when i switched over to excel   since i use it at work still use excel  at home the mis department installed it on my computer for me  based on the microsoft products ive installed at home im sure that the basic installation just took a few minutesif you are familiar with excel  you wont notice too many differences  and if like me at home you are running an eight year old version be prepared for lots of changes  instead of the old familiar drop down menus at the top you now have what they call a ribbon  there are different tabs on the top of your screen and each of those tabs has tons of options  it took me a while to get used to this change and i still have to do a little hunting to find something i dont use too often but now i love it  the default tab is home and it has almost everything you would normally need to do right at your fingertips  you can bold the cell cut and paste chose the number format insert or delete cells or rows sort and auto sum with just the click of a button all from the home tab  once i got used to it it was so much faster  and for those who complained they couldnt customize it before one of the changes in excel  is the ability to customize the ribbonthose who share spreadsheets back and forth will love the fact that comments are now part of excel  just like with word you can leave multiple comments to let a coworker know what changes you think should be made or what errors youve found and already correctedto be honest there are lots of functions to excel that i dont use  i was looking up a list of the changes for excel  and most of them are things i never even use  if you have used excel the new version wont throw you for a loop especially if you have used excel   if you are really upgrading from excel  the new format will take some getting used to but once you do it will be great  a couple cool features i do like are changes to allow faster use although usually it is wait for me and not the other way around and sparklines little graphs that show data in one cell  now that i know about those small graphs im having a blast playing around with themby the time i graduated from college computers were doing the hard work of accounting  my limited exposer to excel mushroomed quickly and i became comfortable with it believe me i know my life is much easier thanks to microsoft excel   i couldnt go back to doing all this by hand,microsoft excel ,289.56,0.40875912408759124,,,-745.94,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,248,85,227,83,489,128,420,126,0.86,0.3,0.34,0.16,3.23,1.27,248,41,42.2,40.5,0.51,0.8,7.93,11.21,0.89,24.53,0.54,0.5,31.0,3.94,0.15,0.59,0.12,0.04,0.15

B000HCTYT4,4.0,i bought a rebuilt laptop from a local seller who i trusted to repair my vintage original  mac as best as it could be repaired since he had done so well with the  and i had some extra money and i wanted to see if he was as good with refurbishing  pcs running xp through  as he was with macswell i bought it home and was going to make backup media but windows vista home basic didnt support that function that was not a good start but i can say except for the streamlining done to windows  it beats windows  starter until you get to windows  starter  which supports a newer version of internet explorer than windows vista home basicbut then again so do  and  support a newer version of internet explorer than windows vista home basic hence the title of my reviewi do like vista home basic compared to windows  and even somewhat compared to windows  starter but the title of my review properly explains itwhen i found vista home basic didnt support making reinstall media i installed windows  professional on the laptop that had this loaded on it and i got everything i loved about vista home basic on this laptop with everything that it lackednot to bash vista home basic because if its legal retail and full install all three it can be updated to be perfectly serviceable and i would love a retail copy of my own for a dell optiplex  that is running xp that is about to go out of support and i dont want to bloat it down with aero but heres the reasons why i upgraded to windows  professional aero like on vista home premium and above aero  enhancements including the superbar and snappeekshake windows media center and full games support after loading the code from the dvd all the same legal retail and full install all three advantages of retail full install home basic that the reseller loaded it improved my opinion of vista home basic from utter crap to windows  without the reasons to want windows  which is why despite its limitations which i will be the first to admit it is limited i am giving it four stars internet explorer upgradeability to version  after installing  which vista home basic got screwed out of upgrades to directx and other functional bits beyond what vista can offernow  reasons why vista specifically home basic legal retail full install has appreciated with time it doesnt expect your computer to support aero thus meaning if your computer supports the minimum system requirements you can be on a par with the level of functionality present in windows  rtm if not  it supports the essentials of the shared  experience even if aero isnt supported even on hardware that could run it its much better than windows  which is the originally planned follow on to vista formerly known as blackcomb that takes the rather radical vista and makes it seem infinitely more manageable even without the windows  facelift it does support  so you will be able to do a little bit as regards  you may not like the new taskbar in windows  that  even removes the start menu from and you may not be able to find legal home premium or better vista i bought an oem copy of home premium and someone had already used it rendering it illegal after  days and leaving me wishing i had bought a copy of this its so lowend on the windows feature totem pole that the number of pirated copies is likely to be far less than say vista ultimate  professional or  ultimatebonus reason to cover the  service packs windows  interface in the desktop is butt ugly the corresponding look for metro is much better if you dont mind the nickel and diming metro puts you through if you thought windows vista home basic had a plain interface just try windows  desktop mode and youll suddenly be wishing it wouldnt require that much effort  service packs and countless intervening updates plus  and a platform update once youre just about through to reinstall vista home basic if thats what you upgraded to  from on the promoso now that youve heard the reasons why its good and the reasons why i replaced it with windows  you know that its not perfect but with time it has seemed less radical due to how much more radical  is by taking vista to the next level which was microsofts intent with the whistlerlonghornblackcomb os evolution that later turned into  with a detour at  so microsoft wouldnt go bankrupt from ever more insufferable os choicesgiven the true story as only a historian who relies on hundreds of sources can tell you you can see why i am no longer using it but that i do rate it highly for what it is instead of what it isnt thus i am being fair to both the

B000WEJYM4,4.0,i was new to vista when i received my new laptop so i wasnt aware of the changing software landscape that seems to be a hallmark of microsoft products  although i did get the microsoft office suite it now excludes outlook  this made me very very angrywhen the opportunity to review this latest incarnation of outlook came along i jumped at it because life postoutlook is pretty awful and now that im back in the warm bosom of microsofts email program i can breathe a sigh of reliefthis is the same outlook you either love or hate  the programs still seem to be developed independently of each other theres also junk email scanning which is semiuseful if you dont have spam blocking on your server side the reading pane is omnipresent but removable and theres this irritating tendency to group messages into well groups as if the entire world thought that would be a good idea for message sorting  news flash it isnt fortunately it can be turned offthe calendar is the same as other outlook calendars only a little more graphically appealing  you still cannot easily import data from one of the outlook programs to the other dragging and dropping emails preserves body and header  similarly you can drag an email to your contacts but that only drops the email name into the contacts list and dumps the entire body into notes field  in other words theres no smart way to navigate content between the various subprograms within outlook  this is something thats sorely needed  the electronic signature at the bottom of emails is becoming the de facto business card and itd be nice if we could just import that content right into contacts  but alas outlooks not about to be that innovativethe other new thing that hangs around waiting for you to notice it is the todo bar  as if navigating the myriad of outlook programs who dont really like each other wasnt difficult enough you are now expected to navigate sideways  from a space perspective this makes sense theres more real estate on the horizontal axis of most monitors  but it is counterintuitive to the rest of the outlook design which is top to bottom the todo bar is basically what used to happen when you clicked on your name in older versions of outlook it summarizes all your relevant information in one place the problem is that it wont go away easily it eventually goes away if you can figure out how to ask it nicely  but apparently each application is treated like its own entity so removing the todo bar from say email means it still shows up when youre in tasksfinally theres whats new in this version of outlook the business contact manager  it requires sql server this is most useful if youre running a business and contains everything from projects to accounts billable hours to marketing campaigns  its of particular use to freelancers and hourly consultants as a consultant myself once i ended up using the journal to clock my progress but the bcm can do it better  being the new kid on the block bcm is better integrated with all the other programsat times outlooks various programs seem like squabbling inlaws at a weddingrelated and not happy about it  if you can look past that  and if youre a seasoned outlook user chances are youre used to it  then this is definitely worth the investment,microsoft office outlook  with business contact manager old version,99.99,0.5270506108202443,,,-501.67,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,230,92,215,90,351,125,302,122,0.86,0.4,0.4,0.31,7.48,1.93,230,39,43.3,42.8,0.66,0.85,8.68,12.28,0.93,35.29,0.71,0.82,51.55,5.08,0.21,0.7,0.15,0.07,0.22
